-- | Haskell implementation of the Google+ API v1
--   
--   Will implement the Google+ REST API. Google+ is a social network made
--   by Google. Found out more at <a>http://plus.google.com</a>. Implements
--   the full API as of Oct 15, 2011. Only features read-only API access
--   beacuse that is all that Google has published thus far. Both API and
--   OAuth authentication is supported, but note that if you intend to use
--   OAuth, this library does not currently provide the means to procure
--   and renew OAuth tokens.
@package googleplus
@version 0.3.1.1

module Web.GooglePlus

-- | Get a person who matches the given identifier
getPerson :: PersonID -> GooglePlusM (Either Text Person)

-- | Get an activity which matches the given activity ID
getActivity :: ID -> GooglePlusM (Either Text Activity)

-- | Get a comment which matches the given comment ID
getComment :: ID -> GooglePlusM (Either Text Comment)

-- | Get an activity who matches the given activity ID and collection to
--   use. Default page size is (20) and only fetches the first page. You
--   will receive an error from the server if the page size exceeds 100.
getLatestActivityFeed :: PersonID -> ActivityCollection -> Maybe Integer -> GooglePlusM (Either Text ActivityFeed)

-- | Paginating enumerator to consume a user's activity stream. Each chunk
--   will end up being an array with a single ActivityFeed in it with 1
--   page of data in it. This weirdness about the chunks only containing 1
--   element is mostly to maintain the metadata available on ActivityFeed
--   and have it available in each chunk. For a more natural chunking of
--   just Activities if you don't need that additional metadata, see
--   enumActivities. Note that this Enumerator will abort if it encounters
--   an error from the server, thus cutting the list short.
enumActivityFeed :: PersonID -> ActivityCollection -> Maybe Integer -> Enumerator ActivityFeed GooglePlusM b

-- | Simplified version of enumActivityFeed which retrieves all pages of an
--   activity feed and merges them into one. Note that this will not be as
--   efficient as enumActivityFeed in terms of memory/time because it
--   collects them all in memory first. Note that this should incur 1 API
--   call per page of results, so the max page size of 100 is used.
getActivityFeed :: PersonID -> ActivityCollection -> GooglePlusM ActivityFeed

-- | Paginating enumerator yielding a Chunk for each page. Use this if you
--   don't need the feed metadata that enumActivityFeed provides.
enumActivities :: PersonID -> ActivityCollection -> Maybe Integer -> Enumerator Activity GooglePlusM b

-- | Simplified version of enumActivities that fetches all the activitys of
--   a Person first, thus returning them. Note that this should incur 1 API
--   call per page of results, so the max page size of 100 is used.
getActivities :: PersonID -> ActivityCollection -> GooglePlusM [Activity]

-- | Search for a member of Google+. Paginating enumerator yielding a Chunk
--   for each page. Note that this Enumerator will abort if it encounters
--   an error from the server, thus cutting the list short.
enumPersonSearch :: Text -> Maybe Integer -> Enumerator PersonSearchResult GooglePlusM b

-- | Returns the full result set for a person search given a search string.
--   This interface is simpler to use but does not have the
--   flexibility/memory usage benefit of enumPersonSearch.
getPersonSearch :: Text -> GooglePlusM [PersonSearchResult]

-- | Find people associated with a particular Activity. Paginating
--   enumerator yielding a Chunk for each page. Paginating enumerator
--   yielding a Chunk for each page. Note that this Enumerator will abort
--   if it encounters an error from the server, thus cutting the list
--   short.
enumPeopleByActivity :: ID -> ListByActivityCollection -> Maybe Integer -> Enumerator Person GooglePlusM b

-- | Returns the full result set for a person search given a search string.
--   This interface is simpler to use but does not have the
--   flexibility/memory usage benefit of enumPeopleByActivity.
getPeopleByActivity :: ID -> ListByActivityCollection -> GooglePlusM [Person]

-- | Search for an activity on Google+. Paginating enumerator yielding a
--   Chunk for each page. Note that this Enumerator will abort if it
--   encounters an error from the server, thus cutting the list short.
enumActivitySearch :: Text -> SearchOrderBy -> Maybe Integer -> Enumerator Activity GooglePlusM b

-- | Returns the full result set for an activity search given a search
--   string. This interface is simpler to use but does not have the
--   flexibility/memory usage benefit of enumActivitySearch.
getActivitySearch :: Text -> SearchOrderBy -> GooglePlusM [Activity]

-- | Find comments for an activity on Google+. Paginating enumerator
--   yielding a Chunk for each page. Note that this Enumerator will abort
--   if it encounters an error from the server, thus cutting the list
--   short.
enumComments :: ID -> Maybe Integer -> Enumerator Comment GooglePlusM b

-- | Returns the full result set for an activity's comments. This interface
--   is simpler to use but does not have the flexibility/memory usage
--   benefit of enumComments.
getComments :: ID -> GooglePlusM [Comment]
data SearchOrderBy

-- | Sort by relevance to the to the user, most relevant first

-- | Sort by most recent results first
Recent :: SearchOrderBy
