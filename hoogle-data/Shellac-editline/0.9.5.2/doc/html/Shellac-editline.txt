-- | Editline backend module for Shellac
--   
--   This package provides a Shellac backend based on the editline library.
--   editline provides a subset of the functionality provided by the GNU
--   readline library. However, it is licenced with a BSD-style license and
--   is therefore suitable for some situations where GNU readline is not.
--   This backend features all the line editing capabilities provided by
--   editline.
@package Shellac-editline
@version 0.9.5.2


-- | This module implements a Shellac backend based on the editline
--   library.
--   
--   Both the code for this binding and the editline library itself are
--   licenced under BSD-style licences.
