-- | Monadic functions which provide Choice and Parallelism.
--   
--   This package defines Monadic functions which provide Choice and
--   Parallelism - (&amp;lt;||&amp;rt;) and (&amp;lt;&amp;&amp;&amp;rt;) -
--   that work on Monads that provide a (MonadBi m IO) instance. Depends on
--   the <tt>monadbi</tt> library for extracting the IO actions from m.
--   Also provides a good example of how to use the library.
