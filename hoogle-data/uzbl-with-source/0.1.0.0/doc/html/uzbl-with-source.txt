--   
--   Utility function for reading a source of loaded uzbl pages. It attemps
--   to read the UZBL_SOCKET variable passed in by uzbl during runtime and
--   extract source by probing it. The program ‘socat’ is a run-time
--   dependency.
@package uzbl-with-source
@version 0.1.0.0


-- | Deals with retrieving page source from running uzbl instance. Possibly
--   will deal more in the future, such as overwriting the page.
module Uzbl.WithSource

-- | Retrieves the source code of a currently loaded page in the uzbl
--   browser from the <tt>UZBL_SOCKET</tt> environmental variable. If the
--   variable is not set, we get back <a>Nothing</a>. If reading from or
--   writing to the socket fails, we also get back <a>Nothing</a>.
