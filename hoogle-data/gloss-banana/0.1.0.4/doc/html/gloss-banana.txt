-- | An Interface for gloss in terms of a reactive-banana Behavior.
--   
--   This package exports a simple wrapper, in terms of
--   Graphics.Gloss.Interface.IO.Game, that allows full control of the
--   picture generated by Gloss as a Behavior, as well as providing access
--   to Gloss' clock and input-handling functionality as Events.
@package gloss-banana
@version 0.1.0.4

module Graphics.Gloss.Interface.FRP.ReactiveBanana

-- | Play the game in a window, updating when the value of the provided
--   Behavior t Picture changes.
playBanana :: Display -> Color -> Int -> (forall t. Frameworks t => Event t Float -> Event t InputEvent -> Moment t (Behavior t Picture)) -> IO ()

-- | A useful type synonym for Gloss event values, to avoid confusion
--   between Gloss and ReactiveBanana.
type InputEvent = Event
