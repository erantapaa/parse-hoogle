-- | Hpc-generated strobes for a running Haskell program
--   
--   A rudimentary library that demonstrates the possibility of using Hpc
--   (Haskell Program Coverage) to inspect the state of a running Haskell
--   program. Use of the library involves a simple change of the main
--   function and also requires the program to be enabled for hpc. At the
--   time of writing, this means using a fairly recent version of GHC and
--   compiling the Haskell code with the <tt>-fhpc</tt> option.

--   and strobes (separate Hpc tix files) will be written regularly, with 1
--   second (1000000 microseconds) between each writing of a strobe. The
--   tix files will be deposited in the indicated tixfile directory and be
--   named "myMain_&lt;index&gt;.tix" where the index is taken from [0..].
