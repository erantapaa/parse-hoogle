module Numeric.Ransac

-- | <tt>ransac iter sampleSize agreePct fit residual goodFit pts</tt>
--   draws <tt>iter</tt> samples of size <tt>sampleSize</tt> from
--   <tt>pts</tt>. The <tt>fit</tt> function is used to produce a model
--   from each of these samples. The elements of <tt>pts</tt> whose
--   residuals pass the <tt>goodFit</tt> predicate with respect to this
--   model are identified as <i>inliers</i>, and used to update the model.
--   The model for which the size of the inliers set is at least
--   <tt>agreePct</tt> percent of the entire data set and whose error over
--   all points is minimal among all sampled models is returned. If no
--   acceptable model is found (i.e. no model whose inliers were at least
--   <tt>agreePct</tt> percent of the entire data set), <a>Nothing</a> is
--   returned.
