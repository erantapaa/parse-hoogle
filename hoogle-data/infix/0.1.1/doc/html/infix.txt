-- | Infix expression re-parsing (for HsParser library)
--   
--   The Haskell parser does not consider the fixity of operators when
--   parsing infix applications. All infix applications are thus parsed as
--   if the operators were all left associative with the same precedence.
--   This module contains code for re-parsing infix applications taking
--   into account the fixity of operators. The important algorithm is the
--   well known operator precedence parsing algorithm. See comments in the
--   code for more detailed information.
