-- | (deprecated) Read instances for 'Data.Vector'
--   
--   Read instances for <a>Data.Vector</a>. Right now, only for unboxed
--   vectors. Others should be easy to implement, though.
--   
--   It is planned to have read instances included in the vector library in
--   the future. This release is only temporary.
--   
--   vector &gt;= 0.8 has Read instances for all immutable vectors.
@package vector-read-instances
@version 0.0.2.0


-- | Read instance for unboxed vectors.
module Data.Vector.Unboxed.Read
