-- | Send a Wake on LAN Magic Packet
--   
--   A program and library to a send WoL Magic Packet, to remotely start a
--   computer.
--   
--   This program is useful if you have a computer that you keep at a
--   friend's house because he has a fast internet connection. But he keeps
--   turning the machine off, saying that it warms up his room and your not
--   using it anyway. But now you need a way to turn the machine back on...
--   
--   Usage:
--   
--   <pre>
--   $ wol hostname macaddress [portnumber]
--   </pre>
--   
--   If the hostname is not statically known, you can try using LAN
--   broadcast (<tt>255.255.255.255</tt>).
@package wol
@version 0.1.2
