-- | Indian Language Font Converter
--   
--   The package is made for people who want to get the sentences in Hindi
--   or Marathi font so that they don't need to remember keys on keyboards
--   when they type Hindi or Marathi script. Or they don't need to waste
--   time on virtual keyboards where everything works with a mouse.
