-- | Ungarble output from several threads
--   
--   This library provides a simple interface to output status messages
--   from more than one thread.
--   
--   It will continue adding information (such as dots, or "done") to the
--   correct line and continue scrolling when a line is done.
--   
--   For example, this screen:
--   
--   <pre>
--   Thread ThreadId 27: still working... done
--   Thread ThreadId 25: still working...
--   Thread ThreadId 26: still working...
--   _
--   </pre>
--   
--   will, once thread 25 has finished, look like this:
--   
--   <pre>
--   Thread ThreadId 25: still working... done
--   Thread ThreadId 27: still working... done
--   Thread ThreadId 26: still working...
--   _
--   </pre>
--   
--   If standard output is not a terminal, it will only print complete
--   lines and not output any control characters.
--   
--   At the moment, it can only handle lines that are shorter than the
--   terminal. If they are not, output will be garbled again.
