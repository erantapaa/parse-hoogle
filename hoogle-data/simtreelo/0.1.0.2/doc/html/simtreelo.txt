-- | Loader for data organized in a tree
--   
@package simtreelo
@version 0.1.0.2


-- | This library loads trees that are described through text. In order to
--   preserve readability, the hierarchy of the tree is give exclusively by
--   the indentation level, which can be any number of spaces or tabs, as
--   long as coherence is kept.
--   
--   The first line of the file describes the comment pattern. Every line
--   contains one node of the tree, and the parent is determined by the
--   indentation level, which is given by tabs or spaces. Whitespaces on
--   the right of names are ignored. If the first line is empty, comments
--   will be disabled.
--   
--   Example file:
--   
--   <pre>
--   --
--   A node -- this is a comment
--     Child -- indentation is given by 2 spaces here
--   Brother
--     Debora
--       Edward
--   </pre>
module Data.Simtreelo

-- | The input <a>String</a> must be organized in such a way that every
--   child is one indentation lower than its parent, and all siblings have
--   the same indentation.
--   
--   The <a>String</a> used for indentation is inferred from the first
--   indentation depth
--   
--   The entire first line (except the newline character) represents the
--   beginning of a comment
--   
--   Returns the first error message on failure, or the <a>Tree</a> on
--   success
