-- | Use system-filepath data types with conduits.

--   Provides ability to traverse a folder structure efficiently, as well
--   as convenience wrappers for reading from and writing to files.

module Data.Conduit.Filesystem

-- | Starting at some root directory, traverse the filesystem and enumerate
--   every file (or symlink to a file) found.
--   
--   Note: the option of whether to follow symlinks is currently only
--   checked on POSIX platforms, as the <tt>Win32</tt> package does not
--   support querying symlink status. On Windows, symlinks will always be
--   followed.
traverse :: MonadIO m => Bool -> FilePath -> Producer m FilePath

-- | Same as <a>sourceFile</a>, but uses system-filepath's
--   <tt>FilePath</tt> type.
sourceFile :: MonadResource m => FilePath -> Producer m ByteString

-- | Same as <a>sinkFile</a>, but uses system-filepath's <tt>FilePath</tt>
--   type.
sinkFile :: MonadResource m => FilePath -> Consumer ByteString m ()
