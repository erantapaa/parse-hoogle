-- | Parsing and processing s-records.
--   
--   S-records are common binary files used in embedded programming. This
--   library provides basic parsing, generation, and other utilities for
--   s-records.

-- | Prints (formats) an s-record file.

-- | Merge consecutive blocks into one. If blocks are not contiguous, the
--   padding byte is used to fill in the extra space. If the blocks
--   overlap, an error is thrown.
