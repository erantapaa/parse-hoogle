-- | A small and simple text file configuration library written in Haskell.
--   It is similar to the INI file format, but lacks a few of it's
--   features, such as sections. It is suitable for simple games that need
--   to keep track of certain information between plays.
module Data.TConfig

-- | Utility function. Searches a configuration for a key, and returns it's
--   value.
getValue :: Key -> Conf -> Maybe Value

-- | Utility function. Replaces the value associated with a key in a
--   configuration.
repConfig :: Key -> Value -> Conf -> Conf

-- | Reads a file and parses to a Map String String.
readConfig :: FilePath -> IO Conf

-- | Parses a parsed configuration back to a file.
writeConfig :: FilePath -> Conf -> IO ()

-- | Utility function. Removes a key and it's value from the configuration.
remKey :: Key -> Conf -> Conf

-- | Adds a key and value to the end of the configuration.
addKey :: Key -> Value -> Conf -> Conf
