-- | Create an RV based on a widget's attribute and a handler. Before

reactivePropertyH :: Eq b => self -> (self -> IO () -> IO (ConnectId self)) -> Attr self b -> ReactiveFieldReadWrite IO b

-- | A passive reactive value is one that does not report when it changes.
--   
--   This function returns a RW RV that encloses the given property,
--   without firing change events. The value of the attribute is *not* set
--   if it is the same as the current one.
--   
--   To set without diffing, see <a>passivePropertyNE</a>.
passiveProperty :: Eq b => self -> Attr self b -> ReactiveFieldReadWrite IO b

-- | Return a RW RV that encloses the given property, without firing change
--   events.
--   
--   When writing to this RV, the value is *not* diffed against the
--   previous one. The underlying widget can thus still fire signals based
--   on that change.
