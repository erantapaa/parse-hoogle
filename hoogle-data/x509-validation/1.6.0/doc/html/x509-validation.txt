module Data.X509.Validation

-- | identification of the connection consisting of the fully qualified
--   host name (e.g. www.example.com) and an optional suffix.
--   
--   The suffix is not used by the validation process, but is used by the
--   optional cache to identity certificate per service on a specific host.
--   For example, one might have a different certificate on 2 differents
--   ports (443 and 995) for the same host.
--   
--   for TCP connection, it's recommended to use: :port, or :service for
--   the suffix.
