--   should be disconnected

-- | The <a>RequestPipeline</a> acts as a specification for your service,
--   indicating both a parser/request object generator, the RequestCreator,
--   and the processor of these requests, one that ultimately generates a
--   response expressed by a blaze <a>Builder</a>

-- | The RequestCreator is an Attoparsec parser that yields some request

-- | The RequestProcessor is a function in the IO monad (for DB access,
--   etc) that returns a builder that can generate the response
type RequestProcessor a = a -> IO Builder
