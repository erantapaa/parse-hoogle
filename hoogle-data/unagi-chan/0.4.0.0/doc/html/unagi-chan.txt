tryRead :: Element a -> IO (Maybe a)

-- | Return a lazy list representing the contents of the supplied OutChan,

getChanContents :: OutChan a -> IO [a]

-- | Write a value to the channel. If the chan is full this will block.
--   
--   To be precise this <i>may</i> block when the number of elements in the

--   size*2</tt>, where <tt>size</tt> is the argument passed to
--   <tt>newChan</tt>, rounded up to the next highest power of two.
--   
--   <i>Note re. exceptions</i>: In the case that an async exception is

writeChan :: InChan a -> a -> IO ()

-- | Try to write a value to the channel, aborting if the write is likely

--   
--   This function never blocks, but may occasionally write successfully to
--   a queue that is already "full". Unlike <a>writeChan</a> this function
--   treats the requested bounds (raised to nearest power of two) strictly,
--   rather than using the <tt>n .. n*2</tt> range. The more concurrent
--   writes and reads that are happening, the more inaccurate the estimate

tryWriteChan :: InChan a -> a -> IO Bool

-- | Write an entire list of items to a chan type. Writes here from

--   from both the original <tt>OutChan</tt> and the one returned here,
--   creating a kind of broadcast channel.
--   
--   Writers will be blocked only when the fastest reader falls behind the

--   arbitrarily behind.

-- | Produce the specified number of interleaved "streams" from a chan.
