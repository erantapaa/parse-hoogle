module IO.Filesystem
data File
File :: (Maybe String) -> (Maybe Bytes) -> File
Directory :: (Map String File) -> File
data DirEntry
DirEntry :: FilePath -> File -> DirEntry
getFile :: FilePath -> IO File

-- | The working directory, as a DirEntry
workingDirectory :: IO DirEntry
data Location
Here :: Location
Cache :: Location
Owner :: Location
System :: Location
pathTo :: ?progName :: FilePath => Location -> FilePath
getConfig :: ?progName :: FilePath => IO File

-- | The FS monad is a wrapper around the IO monad that provides a
--   MonadState instance for interacting with the filesystem through the
--   Filesystem type.
--   
--   Thus, you may use lenses to access the representation of files as
--   though they were variables, like so :
--   
--   <pre>
--   runFS $ (file "x.bmp".bytes.serial.from bmp) fs ^&gt;= \r -&gt;
--       file "foo".bytes.serial.from jpg =- r
--   </pre>
