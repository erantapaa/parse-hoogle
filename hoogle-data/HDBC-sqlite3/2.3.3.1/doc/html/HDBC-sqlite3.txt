@package HDBC-sqlite3
@version 2.3.3.1


-- | HDBC driver interface for Sqlite 3.x.
--   
--   Written by John Goerzen, jgoerzen@complete.org
module Database.HDBC.Sqlite3

-- | Connect to an Sqlite version 3 database. The only parameter needed is
--   the filename of the database to connect to.
--   
--   All database accessor functions are provided in the main HDBC module.
connectSqlite3 :: FilePath -> IO Connection

-- | Connects to a Sqlite v3 database as with <a>connectSqlite3</a>, but
--   instead of converting the supplied <a>FilePath</a> to a C String by
--   performing a conversion to Unicode, instead converts it by simply
--   dropping all bits past the eighth. This may be useful in rare
--   situations if your application or filesystemare not running in Unicode
--   space.
