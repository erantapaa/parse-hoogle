@package EstProgress
@version 0.2.0.0


-- | Progress estimates.
--   
--   <a>progress</a> is good for functions the recursion trees of which are
--   very unbalanced. <a>progressWithCalls</a> is good for functions that
--   consume their input very long before they finish.
module Data.Progress

-- | Estimate progress based on thunks forced.
progress :: Data s => (s -> IO b) -> s -> IO b

-- | ...based on amount of file consumed.
progressWithFile :: (Handle -> IO b) -> Handle -> IO b

-- | ...based on number of recursive calls.
--   
--   It returns a result equivalent to that of <i>fix f x</i>.
progressWithCalls :: ((t -> IO b) -> t -> IO b) -> t -> IO b

-- | Adapters for pure functions.
