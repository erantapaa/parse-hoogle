--   Hack handler direct to fastcgi
@package hack-handler-fastcgi
@version 0.2.0


-- | Interface for FastCGI <a>http://fastcgi.com/</a>, using the fcgiapp
--   API. Totally ripped off by Michael Snoyman to work with Hack.
module Hack.Handler.FastCGI

-- | Handle a single CGI request, or FastCGI requests in an infinite loop.
--   This function only returns normally if it was a CGI request. This lets
--   you use the same program as either a FastCGI or CGI program, depending
--   on what the server treats it as.
runFastCGIorCGI :: Application -> IO ()

-- | Handle a single FastCGI or CGI request. This lets you use the same
--   program as either a FastCGI or CGI program, depending on what the
--   server treats it as.
runOneFastCGIorCGI :: Application -> IO Bool

-- | Handle FastCGI requests in an infinite loop.
runFastCGI :: Application -> IO ()

-- | Handle a single FastCGI request.
runOneFastCGI :: Application -> IO ()

-- | Like <tt>Network.CGI.runCGI</tt>, but uses the FastCGI interface and
--   forks off a new thread (using <a>forkOS</a>) for every request.
runFastCGIConcurrent :: Int -> Application -> IO ()
runFastCGIConcurrent' :: (IO () -> IO a) -> Int -> Application -> IO ()
