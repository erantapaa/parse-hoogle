-- | Wrappers for web frameworks to ease usage with the FP Complete environment.
--   
--   This package provides very simplistic wrappers to enable running code
--   using the Snap and Happstack web frameworks on the FP Complete
--   environment. The only modification to standard behavior is that the
--   port number is read from the PORT environment variable as opposed to
--   being specified on either the command line or in the code itself. If
--   you're using Yesod, the function warpEnv is provided in the Yesod
--   module itself, which performs the same function.
--   
--   For the most part, it should be sufficient to import the relevant
--   module from this package in place of the standard module, e.g. import
--   <tt>Snap.Http.Server.Env</tt> instead of <tt>Snap.Http.Server</tt>, or
--   <tt>Happstack.Server.Env</tt> instead of <tt>Happstack.Server</tt>.
@package web-fpco
@version 0.1.1.0

module Happstack.Server.Env

-- | An alternate <tt>simpleHTTP</tt> which reads the port to listen to
--   from the PORT environment variable. This configuration approach is
--   used by the FP Complete School of Haskell and the Keter deployment
--   manager.
simpleHTTP :: ToMessage a => Conf -> ServerPartT IO a -> IO ()

module Snap.Http.Server.Env

-- | An alternate <tt>httpServe</tt> which reads the port to listen to from
--   the PORT environment variable. This configuration approach is used by
--   the FP Complete School of Haskell and the Keter deployment manager.
httpServe :: Config Snap a -> Snap () -> IO ()
