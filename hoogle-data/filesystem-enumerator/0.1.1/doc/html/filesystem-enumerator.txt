-- | Enumerator-based API for manipulating the filesystem.
module Filesystem.Enumerator

-- | Starting at some root directory, traverse the filesystem and enumerate
--   every file (or symlink to a file) found.
--   
--   Note: the option of whether to follow symlinks is currently only
--   checked on POSIX platforms, as the <tt>Win32</tt> package does not
--   support querying symlink status. On Windows, symlinks will always be
--   followed.
traverse :: MonadIO m => Bool -> FilePath -> Enumerator FilePath m a

-- | Enumerate entries in a directory. Entries are returned with their full
--   path. Entries are read from the directory handle as needed, so this is
--   safe to use with very large directories.
enumDirectory :: FilePath -> Enumerator FilePath IO a
