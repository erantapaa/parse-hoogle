-- | Parser and datatypes for the JSON Resume format
--   
--   The JSON Resume initiative (<a>http://jsonresume.org</a>) provides a
--   standard format for representing resumes/CVs in JSON form. This
--   library encodes that standard in Haskell datatypes, and provides a
--   parser to read a CV in the JSON Resume format.
@package jsonresume
@version 0.1.0.1


-- | This module provides a native Haskell representation for the JSON
--   Resume scheme, as defined at
--   <a>https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/blob/master/schema.json</a>,
--   as well as instances for Aeson's FromJSON/ToJSON classes to make
--   parsing the files easy.
--   
--   Note that nearly all the fields are wrapped in a Maybe type. This is
--   because the JSON scheme on which this is based doesn't specify one way
--   or the other whether a field is required, and in JSON essentially all
--   the fields are optional.
module Data.JSONResume

-- | This is the main datatype, representing the overall structure of the
--   JSON Resume specification.
