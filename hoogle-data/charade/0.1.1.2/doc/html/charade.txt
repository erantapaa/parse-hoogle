module Heist.Charade

-- | Charade needs to provide a splice that can be bound to eliminate all
--   charade-specific attributes from the markup.
charadeProductionSplice :: Monad n => Splice n

-- | An initializer function that allows you to use charade functionality
--   in your own applications. This is useful in situations where you have
--   implemented some of your application's functionality and you want your
--   designers to use that, but you also want them to have charade
--   functionality when working on portions of the site for which the
--   backend has not been written yet.
--   
--   This is not a normal initializer. You don't need to use nestSnaplet
--   with it. Just call it directly from your application initializer. When
--   used in this mode, you don't need a separate charade.cfg file. Just
--   put a charade block in your application config, extract it with the
--   <tt>subconfig</tt> function, and pass it to this function.
