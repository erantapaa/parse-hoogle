--   Parallel rendering of raster images using Accelerate
@package gloss-raster-accelerate
@version 1.8.0.0

module Graphics.Gloss.Accelerate.Render

-- | The type of executing Accelerate computations. The CUDA and
--   Interpreter backends both provide a function <a>run1</a> that can be
--   used.
--   
--   Some variants of the display functions take an argument of this type,
--   which determine how computations are executed.
type Render = forall a b. (Arrays a, Arrays b) => (Acc a -> Acc b) -> a -> b

-- | The set of backends available to execute Accelerate programs. The
--   default chooses the fastest available, which is currently the CUDA
--   backend. This is controlled via the import statements.

module Graphics.Gloss.Accelerate.Raster.Array

module Graphics.Gloss.Accelerate.Raster.Field

-- | The type of executing Accelerate computations. The CUDA and

--   
--   The parameter <tt>world</tt> at this point can be arbitrary. However
--   if you use this function standalone, you will probably at some point
--   want the result of this function to plug into <a>makePicture</a> and
--   thus <a>Render</a>, and thus be a unary function from <a>Arrays</a> to
--   <a>Arrays</a>.
