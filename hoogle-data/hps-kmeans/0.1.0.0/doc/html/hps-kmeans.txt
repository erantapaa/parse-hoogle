-- | A nice implementation of the k-Means algorithm.
--   
--   An implementation of the k-Means algorithm in Haskell that aims to be
--   simple, readable, extendable and efficient enough to be used as a
--   building block. More finger-typed documentation can be found in
--   <a>http://stathacking.com/hps-kmeans</a>
@package hps-kmeans
