module Data.Traversable.Cached

-- | Traverse the given structure, retrieving values from and storing
--   values in the cache at the given path. Only the element type need be
--   serializable. The struture must be lazy in the values for this to be
--   effective. This does not work well for large structures because the
--   entire cache is rewritten every time a new value is computed. Works
--   best when values are small, but expensive to compute. Atomicity and
--   consistency are weakly guaranteed by writing the cache to a new file
--   every time, and renaming the file into place.
