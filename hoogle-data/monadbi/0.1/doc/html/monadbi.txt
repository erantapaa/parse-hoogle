-- | Extract underlying monads from monad transformers
--   
--   This module provides a Class called <tt>MonadBi</tt> which acts as a
--   superset of <tt>MonadTrans</tt>, and provides <tt>raise</tt> analogous
--   to <tt>lift</tt>, i.e. lifts underlying monads into the transformer.
--   It also provides <tt>lower</tt> which is the opposite of
--   <tt>lift</tt>, and extracts underlying monads from monad transformers.
--   Generally speaking, MonadBi represents the relationship between monads
--   that can be transformed into each other (atleast partially). Natural
--   instances are provided for many Monad Transformers.
