-- | Compare two types of any (possibly different) kinds.
module Type.Compare

-- | Compare two types of any (possibly different) kinds. Since
--   <a>Compare</a> itself is a closed type family, add instances to
--   <a>CompareUser</a> if you want to compare other types.

-- | The largest type (and kind) on <a>Compare</a>.
data LargestK
Largest :: LargestK

-- | The smallest type (and kind) on <a>Compare</a>.
data SmallestK
Smallest :: SmallestK

-- | Compare two types, of any kinds, which are not compared within
--   <a>Compare</a>. Users can add instances.
