-- | a tiny library for using shared lens fields
--   
--   A simple single-module library for creating lens field typeclasses in
--   a way that allows them to be shared between modules. By default, lens'
--   <tt>makeFields</tt> creates a new class if it can't find a matching
--   one in scope. This means that if you try to <tt>makeFields</tt>
--   records in different modules without importing one module into the
--   other, you'll get conflicting class definitions rather than a single
--   lens which functions with both records.
@package shared-fields
@version 0.2.0.0

module Control.Lens.TH.SharedFields

-- | Generate classes for a field that will be shared between modules
--   without using <tt>makeFields</tt> (which would create an extra
--   instance at minimum)
generateField :: String -> Q [Dec]

-- | Generate classes for multiple fields. Use this if you want to define a
--   bunch of fields.
