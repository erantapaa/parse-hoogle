-- | Filesystem to manage and parse dotfiles
--   
--   A system which, when pointed to a folder full of specially annotated
--   config files, will present these files tailored to your current
--   environment. Useful for making, for example, an if-block in your
--   mutt-config depending on your current location, which you can retrieve
--   via some shell command.
