--   Load average parsing from <tt>/proc/loadavg</tt> and bindings to
--   <tt>getloadavg (3)</tt>
@package loadavg
@version 0.1


-- | There are two basic ways you can get load average on a modern Linux
--   system. First is <tt>getloadavg (3)</tt> system call. The second is
--   <tt>/proc/loadavg</tt> file. This module provides means of getting the
--   information from both sources. <tt>/proc/loadavg</tt> provides some
--   additional information but we ignore that.
module System.Posix.LoadAvg
data LoadAvg
LoadAvg :: !Double -> !Double -> !Double -> LoadAvg

-- | sample for last 1 minute
sample_1 :: LoadAvg -> !Double

-- | sample for last 5 minutes
sample_5 :: LoadAvg -> !Double

-- | sample for last 15 minutes
sample_15 :: LoadAvg -> !Double

-- | Tries to parse the output of <tt>/proc/loadavg</tt>. If anything goes
--   wrong an arbitrary exception will be raised.
parseLoadAvg :: String -> LoadAvg

-- | Discards error checking from getLoadAvgSafe. Will raise IO exception
--   on error.
getLoadAvg :: IO LoadAvg

-- | Calls <tt>getloadavg (3)</tt> to get system load average. Provides
--   error checking, and the result may be Nothing in case of error. If
--   there is not enough data the samples will be copied from more recent
--   samples.
getLoadAvgSafe :: IO (Maybe LoadAvg)

-- | Tries to read <tt>/proc/loadavg</tt> and parse it's output with
--   <a>parseLoadAvg</a>. Either may fail with IO exception.
getLoadAvgProc :: IO LoadAvg
