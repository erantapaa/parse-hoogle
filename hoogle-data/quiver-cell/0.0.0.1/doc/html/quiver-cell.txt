-- | Quiver combinators for cellular data processing
--   
--   This library provides combinators for Quiver-based streaming of
--   cellular data, i.e., tabular data encoded as a stream of
--   optionally-fragmented cell values.
@package quiver-cell
@version 0.0.0.1


-- | Quiver processors converting between cellular and traditional tabular
--   data.
module Control.Quiver.Cell

-- | A simple Quiver processor that converts a stream of cells into a
--   stream of rows, with each row represented by a non-empty list of cell
--   values.
toRows :: (Monoid a) => SP (Cell a) [a] f ()

-- | A simple Quiver processor that converts a stream of rows to a stream
--   of cells, In this version, the final cell in the table is not marked
--   with <tt>EOT</tt> to avoid the need for row lookahead, delivering the
--   list of any cells that could not be produced from the final consumed
--   row.
--   
--   Empty input rows are ignored.
fromRows :: SP [a] (Cell a) f [a]
