-- | A networked event handling framework for hooking
into other programs.
--   
--   Pup-Events is a networking enabled event handling framework. This
--   package contains the Priority Queue implementation used in the
--   Pup-Events-Client and Pup-Events-Server packages.
@package Pup-Events-PQueue
@version 1.0


-- | Implements Priority Queues intended to be used with the STM module.
module PupEventsPQueue

-- | Returns an empty PQueue with the specified number of priority levels.
makeQueues :: Int -> IO (PQueue a)

-- | Recursively tries to read each priority level until it finds
--   something. If it can't find any events it returns Nothing. Call using
--   <tt>atomically $ getThing pqueue</tt>.
getThing :: PQueue a -> STM (Maybe a)

-- | Writes the given something to the given PQueue at the specified
--   priority level. It does some checking to make sure we have a valid
--   priority level. Call using <tt>atomically $ writeThing pqueue priority
--   thing</tt>.
writeThing :: PQueue a -> Int -> a -> STM ()

-- | A simple alias so we have pretty types.
type PQueue a = [TChan a]
