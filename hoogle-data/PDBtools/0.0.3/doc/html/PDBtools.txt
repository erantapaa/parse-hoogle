-- | A library for analysis of 3-D protein coordinates
--   
--   This is a collection of modules for the analysis of protein
--   coordinates. The suite allows efficient computation on a large data
--   set of RCSB protein data bank files. Parsing returns both protein and
--   ligand coordinates. All of the information in ATOM and HETATM records
--   of a PDB file is preserved.
