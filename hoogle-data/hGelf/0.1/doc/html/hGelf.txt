--   
--   Library for sending messages in the GELF format to a server accepting
--   Graylog2 Extended Log Format messages.

-- | Send a log message to a server accepting Graylog2 messages.
send :: HostName -> String -> Int -> Text -> Maybe Text -> Maybe Text -> Maybe Integer -> [(Text, Maybe Text)] -> IO ()

-- | Encode a log message as a GELF message.
--   
--   This function wraps a given log message in a GELF structure. It
--   creates the JSON object, converts it to a ByteString and GZips the
--   result. If the resulting ByteString is longer than the maximal chunk
--   size, the GELF message is split up into chunks, each at most chunk
--   size in length.
encode :: Int -> Text -> Maybe Text -> String -> Integer -> Maybe Text -> Maybe Integer -> [(Text, Maybe Text)] -> [ByteString]
