-- | Load GPipe textures from filesystem
--   
--   The functions of this package helps loading GPipe textures from file.
--   It is based on the stb-image package, and supports subsets of the JPG,
--   PNG, TGA, BMP and PSD formats.
@package GPipe-TextureLoad
@version 1.0.4


-- | This module provides the means to load all kinds of textures from
--   file. It's based on the stb-image package, and inherits its strengths
--   and limitations. Specifically, it handles a subset of the JPEG, PNG,
--   TGA, BMP and PSD file formats, but is not entirely thread safe. See
--   <a>http://hackage.haskell.org/package/stb-image</a> for more
--   information.
module Graphics.GPipe.Texture.Load

-- | Provides the general way of loading any kind of textures. A 3D texture
--   is assumed to be an array of square images tiled vertically in the
--   image file. Cube textures are assumed to be composed of 6 equally
--   sized images tiled vertically. No additional mipmaps are loaded.
--   
--   Filesystem errors or bad texture dimensions (e.g. loading a cube
--   texture from a file where the height is not a multiple of 6) are
--   thrown as <a>IOError</a>s.
class Texture t => LoadableTexture t
loadTexture :: LoadableTexture t => TextureFormat t -> FilePath -> IO t

-- | Provides an alternative way of loading <a>Texture3D</a>s that are
--   arrays of non-square images tiled vertically. No additional mipmaps
--   are loaded.
--   
--   Filesystem errors or bad texture dimensions (i.e. the height of the
--   image is not a multiple of the supplied depth) are thrown as
--   <a>IOError</a>s.
