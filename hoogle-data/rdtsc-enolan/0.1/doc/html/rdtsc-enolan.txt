--   Haskell binding to sources of high-efficiency, high-precision,
--   monotonically increasing relative time. Tested only on amd64 though,
--   so use it at your own risk. Most of the credit should go to Matteo
--   Frigo and Martin Grabmuller, I only cleaned up the documentation.
@package rdtsc-enolan
@version 0.1


-- | This module provides the function <a>rdtsc</a> for accessing the
--   equivalent of x86's rdtsc instruction on your processor. To
--   oversimplify quite a bit, this is the number of clock cycles since
--   bootup. You should generally only use this as a source of relative
--   time.
--   
--   As an example, you may use the following program to measure the
--   overhead of calling this function:
--   
--   <pre>
--   module Main where
--   import System.CPUTime.Rdtsc
--   
--   main = do
--     t1 &lt;- rdtsc
--     t2 &lt;- rdtsc
--     putStrLn ("Cost of rdtsc (ffi call):    " ++ show (t2 - t1))
--   </pre>
module System.CPUTime.Rdtsc
rdtsc :: IO Word64
