@version 0.2.0.3


-- | An implementation of a 3-way merge algorithm.
module Data.Algorithm.Diff3

-- | A hunk is a collection of changes that occur in a document. A hunk can
--   be some changes only in A, only in B, in both A &amp; B (equally), or
--   conflicting between A, B and the original document. All hunks take 3
--   constructors, which are, in order - the elements in the left document,
--   the original document, and the right document. This order matches the
--   order of parameters to <a>diff3</a>.
data Hunk a
LeftChange :: [a] -> Hunk a
RightChange :: [a] -> Hunk a
Unchanged :: [a] -> Hunk a
Conflict :: [a] -> [a] -> [a] -> Hunk a

-- | Perform a 3-way diff against 2 documents and the original document.
--   This returns a list of <a>Hunk</a>s, where each <a>Hunk</a> contains
--   the original document, a change in the left or right side, or is in
--   conflict. This can be considered a 'low level' interface to the 3-way
--   diff algorithm - you may be more interested in <a>merge</a>.
