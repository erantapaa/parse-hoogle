-- | Happstack extension for use with FastCGI.
--   
--   This library lets you write FastCGI programs with Happstack. This
--   package reuses the SimpleHTTP API, making it very easy to port
--   stand-alone HTTP programs to FastCGI.
@package happstack-fastcgi
@version 0.1.5


-- | Running Happstack applications using FastCGI
--   
--   You need to keep a couple things in mind when configuring a FastCGI
--   Happstack application, especially when using Happstack-state.
--   
--   There are several ways to let Apache + FastCGI handle your
--   application.
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><i>Dynamic</i> This is the easy way. You don't have to configure
--   your server, but can just execute the scripts. FastCGI will spawn
--   instances of your application if needed and kill them if they're not
--   needed anymore. <i>This might break working with
--   Happstack-state!</i></li>
--   <li><i>Static</i> You explicitly need to configure your script in your
--   host config. By default it will only start one process, on server
--   startup. If you want to work with Happstack-state, this is the
--   preferable way, although we have not exhaustively tested that it won't
--   break. |</li>
--   </ul>
