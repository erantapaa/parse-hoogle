-- | Assertions for HUnit with difference reporting
--   
--   HUnit assertion operators that show a diff on failure.
@package HUnit-Diff
@version 0.1


-- | Very basic support for diffing with HUnit.
--   
--   Limitations:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>Prints the whole value, not just the difference with a few lines
--   of context.</li>
--   <li>Relies on the similarity of pretty-printed <a>show</a> results
--   which sorta-kinda works much of the time but may sometimes highlight
--   differences too eagerly.</li>
--   <li>Always colors the differences for ANSI terminals, regardless of
--   output target.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   Despite these limitations, I find it more useful than HUnit's
--   defaults.
