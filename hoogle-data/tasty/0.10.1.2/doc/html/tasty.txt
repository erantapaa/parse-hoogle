@package tasty
@version 0.10.1.2


-- | Extensible options. They are used for provider-specific settings,
--   ingredient-specific settings and core settings (such as the test name
--   pattern).
module Test.Tasty.Options

-- | An option is a data type that inhabits the <a>IsOption</a> type class.

--   If some option has not been explicitly set, the default value is used.
data OptionSet

-- | Set the option value
setOption :: IsOption v => v -> OptionSet -> OptionSet

-- | API for test providers
module Test.Tasty.Providers

-- | The interface to be implemented by a test provider.
--   
--   The type <tt>t</tt> is the concrete representation of the test which
--   is used by the provider.
class Typeable t => IsTest t
run :: IsTest t => OptionSet -> t -> (Progress -> IO ()) -> IO Result
testOptions :: IsTest t => Tagged t [OptionDescription]

-- | <a>Result</a> of a passed test
testPassed :: String -> Result

-- | <a>Result</a> of a failed test
testFailed :: String -> Result

-- | A test result
data Result

-- | Test progress information.
--   
--   This may be used by a runner to provide some feedback to the user
--   while a long-running test is executing.
data Progress
Progress :: String -> Float -> Progress

-- | textual information about the test's progress
progressText :: Progress -> String

-- | <a>progressPercent</a> should be a value between 0 and 1. If it's
--   impossible to compute the estimate, use 0.
progressPercent :: Progress -> Float

-- | The name of a test or a group of tests
type TestName = String

-- | The main data structure defining a test suite.
--   
--   It consists of individual test cases and properties, organized in
--   named groups which form a tree-like hierarchy.
--   
--   There is no generic way to create a test case. Instead, every test
--   provider (tasty-hunit, tasty-smallcheck etc.) provides a function to
--   turn a test case into a <a>TestTree</a>.
--   
--   Groups can be created using <a>testGroup</a>.
data TestTree

-- | Convert a test to a leaf of the <a>TestTree</a>
singleTest :: IsTest t => TestName -> t -> TestTree


-- | This module contains the core definitions related to ingredients.
--   
--   Ingredients themselves are provided by other modules (usually under
--   the <tt>Test.Tasty.Ingredients.*</tt> hierarchy).
module Test.Tasty.Ingredients

-- | <a>Ingredient</a>s make your test suite tasty.
--   
--   Ingredients represent different actions that you can perform on your
--   test suite. One obvious ingredient that you want to include is one
--   that runs tests and reports the progress and results.
--   
--   Another standard ingredient is one that simply prints the names of all
--   tests.
--   
--   Similar to test providers (see <a>IsTest</a>), every ingredient may
--   specify which options it cares about, so that those options are
--   presented to the user if the ingredient is included in the test suite.
--   
--   An ingredient can choose, typically based on the <a>OptionSet</a>,
--   whether to run. That's what the <a>Maybe</a> is for. The first
--   ingredient that agreed to run does its work, and the remaining
--   ingredients are ignored. Thus, the order in which you arrange the
--   ingredients may matter.
--   
--   Usually, the ingredient which runs the tests is unconditional and thus
--   should be placed last in the list. Other ingredients usually run only
--   if explicitly requested via an option. Their relative order thus
--   doesn't matter.
--   
--   That's all you need to know from an (advanced) user perspective. Read
--   on if you want to create a new ingredient.
--   
--   There are two kinds of ingredients.
--   
--   The first kind is <a>TestReporter</a>. If the ingredient that agrees
--   to run is a <a>TestReporter</a>, then tasty will automatically launch
--   the tests and pass a <a>StatusMap</a> to the ingredient. All the
--   ingredient needs to do then is to process the test results and
--   probably report them to the user in some way (hence the name).
--   
--   <a>TestManager</a> is the second kind of ingredient. It is typically
--   used for test management purposes (such as listing the test names),
--   although it can also be used for running tests (but, unlike
--   <a>TestReporter</a>, it has to launch the tests manually if it wants
--   them to be run). It is therefore more general than
--   <a>TestReporter</a>. <a>TestReporter</a> is provided just for
--   convenience.
--   
--   The function's result should indicate whether all the tests passed.
--   
--   In the <a>TestManager</a> case, it's up to the ingredient author to
--   decide what the result should be. When no tests are run, the result
--   should probably be <a>True</a>. Sometimes, even if some tests run and
--   fail, it still makes sense to return <a>True</a>.
data Ingredient

-- | For the explanation on how the callback works, see the documentation
--   for <a>launchTestTree</a>.
TestReporter :: [OptionDescription] -> (OptionSet -> TestTree -> Maybe (StatusMap -> IO (Time -> IO Bool))) -> Ingredient
TestManager :: [OptionDescription] -> (OptionSet -> TestTree -> Maybe (IO Bool)) -> Ingredient

-- | Run the first <a>Ingredient</a> that agrees to be run.
--   
--   If no one accepts the task, return <a>Nothing</a>. This is usually a
--   sign of misconfiguration.
tryIngredients :: [Ingredient] -> OptionSet -> TestTree -> Maybe (IO Bool)

-- | Return the options which are relevant for the given ingredient.
--   
--   Note that this isn't the same as simply pattern-matching on
--   <a>Ingredient</a>. E.g. options for a <a>TestReporter</a>
--   automatically include <a>NumThreads</a>.
ingredientOptions :: Ingredient -> [OptionDescription]

-- | Like <tt>ingredientOption</tt>, but folds over multiple ingredients.
ingredientsOptions :: [Ingredient] -> [OptionDescription]

-- | All the options relevant for this test suite. This includes the
--   options for the test tree and ingredients, and the core options.
suiteOptions :: [Ingredient] -> TestTree -> [OptionDescription]


-- | This module exports the basic ingredients defined in the
--   <tt>tasty</tt> packages.
--   
--   Note that if <tt>defaultIngredients</tt> from <a>Test.Tasty</a> suits
--   your needs, use that instead of importing this module.

newtype Quiet
Quiet :: Bool -> Quiet

-- | Report only failed tests
newtype HideSuccesses

newtype ListTests
ListTests :: Bool -> ListTests

-- | Obtain the list of all tests in the suite
testsNames :: OptionSet -> TestTree -> [TestName]

-- | This ingredient doesn't do anything apart from registering additional

--   
--   The option values can be accessed using <tt>askOption</tt>.
includingOptions :: [OptionDescription] -> Ingredient


-- | API for test runners
module Test.Tasty.Runners

-- | The main data structure defining a test suite.
--   
--   It consists of individual test cases and properties, organized in
--   named groups which form a tree-like hierarchy.
--   
--   There is no generic way to create a test case. Instead, every test
--   provider (tasty-hunit, tasty-smallcheck etc.) provides a function to
--   turn a test case into a <a>TestTree</a>.
--   
--   Groups can be created using <a>testGroup</a>.
data TestTree

-- | A single test of some particular type
SingleTest :: TestName -> t -> TestTree

-- | Assemble a number of tests into a cohesive group
TestGroup :: TestName -> [TestTree] -> TestTree

-- | Add some options to child tests
PlusTestOptions :: (OptionSet -> OptionSet) -> TestTree -> TestTree

-- | Acquire the resource before the tests in the inner tree start and
--   release it after they finish. The tree gets an <a>IO</a> action which
--   yields the resource, although the resource is shared across all the
--   tests.
WithResource :: (ResourceSpec a) -> (IO a -> TestTree) -> TestTree

-- | Ask for the options and customize the tests based on them
AskOptions :: (OptionSet -> TestTree) -> TestTree

-- | Fold a test tree into a single value.
--   
--   The fold result type should be a monoid. This is used to fold multiple
--   results in a test group. In particular, empty groups get folded into
--   <a>mempty</a>.
--   
--   Apart from pure convenience, this function also does the following
--   useful things:
--   
--   <ol>
--   <li>Keeping track of the current options (which may change due to
--   <a>PlusTestOptions</a> nodes)</li>
--   <li>Filtering out the tests which do not match the patterns</li>
--   </ol>
--   
--   Thus, it is preferred to an explicit recursive traversal of the tree.
--   
--   Note: right now, the patterns are looked up only once, and won't be
--   affected by the subsequent option changes. This shouldn't be a problem
--   in practice; OTOH, this behaviour may be changed later.
foldTestTree :: Monoid b => TreeFold b -> OptionSet -> TestTree -> b

-- | An algebra for folding a <a>TestTree</a>.
--   
--   Instead of constructing fresh records, build upon <a>trivialFold</a>
--   instead. This way your code won't break when new nodes/fields are
--   indroduced.
data TreeFold b

foldGroup :: TreeFold b -> TestName -> b -> b
foldResource :: TreeFold b -> forall a. ResourceSpec a -> (IO a -> b) -> b

-- | <a>trivialFold</a> can serve as the basis for custom folds. Just
--   override the fields you need.
--   
--   Here's what it does:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>single tests are mapped to <a>mempty</a> (you probably do want to
--   override that)</li>
--   <li>test groups are returned unmodified</li>
--   <li>for a resource, an IO action that throws an exception is passed
--   (you want to override this for runners/ingredients that execute
--   tests)</li>
--   </ul>
trivialFold :: Monoid b => TreeFold b

-- | <a>ResourceSpec</a> describes how to acquire a resource (the first
--   field) and how to release it (the second field).
data ResourceSpec a
ResourceSpec :: (IO a) -> (a -> IO ()) -> ResourceSpec a

-- | Monoid generated by <a>*&gt;</a>
