--   Simple package that allows for long thread suspensions. Uses newtype
--   wrapper (of Int64 at the moment) to represent delay.
@package suspend
@version 0.1.0.2

module Control.Concurrent.Suspend.Lifted

-- | Analogy of <a>threadDelay</a> that allows for longer delays.
--   
--   Suspends the current thread for the given delay (GHC only).
--   
--   There is no guarantee that the thread will be rescheduled promptly
--   when the delay has expired, but the thread will never continue to run
--   earlier than specified.
