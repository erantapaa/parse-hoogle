module Data.Universe.Instances.Extended

-- | Creating an instance of this class is a declaration that your type is
--   recursively enumerable (and that <a>universe</a> is that enumeration).
--   In particular, you promise that any finite inhabitant has a finite
--   index in <a>universe</a>, and that no inhabitant appears at two
--   different finite indices.
class Universe a
universe :: Universe a => [a]

-- | Creating an instance of this class is a declaration that your
--   <a>universe</a> eventually ends. Minimal definition: no methods
--   defined. By default, <tt>universeF = universe</tt>, but for some types
--   (like <a>Either</a>) the <a>universeF</a> method may have a more
--   intuitive ordering.
