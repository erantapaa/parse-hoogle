-- | A library for demand-driven testing of Haskell programs
--   
--   Lazy SmallCheck is a library for exhaustive, demand-driven testing of
--   Haskell programs. It is based on the idea that if a property holds for
--   a partially-defined input then it must also hold for all fully-defined
--   refinements of the that input. Compared to `<a>eager'</a> input
--   generation as in SmallCheck, Lazy SmallCheck may require significantly
--   fewer test-cases to verify a property for all inputs up to a given
--   depth.
@package lazysmallcheck
@version 0.6


-- | For documentation, see the paper <a>SmallCheck and Lazy SmallCheck:
--   automatic exhaustive testing for small values</a> available at
--   <a>http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/smallcheck/</a>. Several examples are
--   also included in the package.
