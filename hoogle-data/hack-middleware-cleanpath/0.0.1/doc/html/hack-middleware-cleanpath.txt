-- | Applies some basic redirect rules to get cleaner paths.
--   
--   Forces request to have a trailing slash (unless there is a file
--   extension) and ensures there are no doubled slashes. Takes the idea
--   from Django.

module Hack.Middleware.CleanPath

-- | Performs redirects as per <a>splitPath</a>.
cleanPath :: Middleware

-- | Given a certain requested path, return either a corrected path to
--   redirect to or the tokenized path.
--   
--   This code corrects for the following issues:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>It is missing a trailing slash, and there is no period after the
--   last slash.</li>
--   <li>There are any doubled slashes.</li>
--   </ul>
