effectiveTLDPlusOne :: Text -> Maybe Text

-- | This function returns whether or not this domain is owned by a
--   registrar or a regular person. <a>Nothing</a> means that this is a
--   registrar domain; 'Just x' means it's owned by a person. This is used
--   to determine if a cookie is allowed to bet set for a particular
--   domain. For example, you shouldn't be able to set a cookie for "com".
--   
--   If the value is 'Just x', then the x value is what is known as the
--   effective TLD plus one. This is one segment more than the suffix of
--   the domain. For example, the eTLD+1 for <a>this.is.a.subdom.com</a> is
--   Just <a>subdom.com</a>
--   
--   Note that this function expects lowercase ASCII strings. These strings
--   should be gotten from the toASCII algorithm as described in RFC 3490.
--   These strings should not start or end with the '.' character, and
--   should not have two '.' characters next to each other. (The toASCII
--   algorithm is implemented in the 'idna' hackage package, though that
--   package doesn't always map strings to lowercase)
