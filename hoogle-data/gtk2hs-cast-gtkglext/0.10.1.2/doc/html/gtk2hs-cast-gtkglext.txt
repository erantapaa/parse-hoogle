-- | A type class for cast functions of Gtk2hs: gtkglext package
--   
--   This package contains a type class called Cast with a function cast,
--   that is a wrapper for all the castTo* functions of gtk2hs. It makes it
--   easier to write other functions that require a castTo* as a parameter,
--   like xmlGetWidget from glade. The main utility of these packages is to
--   use xmlGetWidgetCast, a version of xmlGetWidget defined in
--   gtk2hs-cast-glade, which has the type: xmlGetWidgetCast :: (Cast
--   widget, WidgetClass widget) =&gt; GladeXML -&gt; String -&gt; IO
--   widget.
--   
--   This is the gtkglext package of gtk2hs-cast, which contains the
--   instances of Cast for the types in the gtkglext package from gtk2hs.
