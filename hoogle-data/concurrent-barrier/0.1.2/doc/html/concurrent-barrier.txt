-- | Simple thread barriers
--   
--   A very simple package providing thread barriers.
@package concurrent-barrier
@version 0.1.2

module Control.Concurrent.Barrier
type Barrier = IO ()

-- | Self-resetting barrier. <a>barrier</a> blocks until a specified number
--   of threads have reached it, and then they are all allowed to run. The
--   barrier is then reset so that a further <tt>count</tt> threads can
--   block on it. Typical usage is:
--   
--   <pre>
--   do b &lt;- barrier 3
--      forkIO $ b &gt;&gt; putStrLn "1"  -- blocked
--      forkIO $ b &gt;&gt; putStrLn "2"  -- blocked
--      forkIO $ b &gt;&gt; putStrLn "3"  -- all three threads run
--   </pre>
barrier :: Int -> IO Barrier

-- | Latching barrier. This is the same as <a>barrier</a>, except once the
--   barrier has opened (the requisite number of threads has reached it),
--   it remains open, allowing all subsequent threads through unblocked.
latchBarrier :: Int -> IO Barrier
