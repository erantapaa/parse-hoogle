-- | OpenGL based viewer for chalkboard rendered images.
--   
--   Chalkboard is a Haskell hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
--   image generation and processing. The basic structure is a chalk board,
--   a two-dimensional canvas of values, typically colors. Chalkboard
--   provides the usual image processing functions (masking, overlaying,
--   function mapping, cropping, warping, rotating) as well as a few more
--   unusual ones.
--   
--   Chalkboard Viewer is a portal into a dynamically updatable Board, via
--   an OpenGL window.

-- | Simple Viewer for Chalkboard Images, using OpenGL.
module Graphics.Chalkboard.Viewer

-- | <a>initBoardViewer</a> never returns, and must be run from the main
--   thread. Two arguments should be provided; the inital window setup, and
--   the MVar that will contain the Board to be displayed.
initBoardViewer :: [BoardViewerInit] -> MVar (Board RGB) -> IO ()
data BoardViewerInit

-- | initial window size
WindowSize :: Int -> Int -> BoardViewerInit

-- | initial window position
WindowPos :: Int -> Int -> BoardViewerInit

-- | big pixels; great for prototyping
PixelSize :: Int -> BoardViewerInit

-- | do we sample beyond the unit square (not yet supported)
Zoom :: BoardViewerInit

-- | default background in non-zoom mode
Background :: RGB -> BoardViewerInit

-- | how many frames per second?
FrameTarget :: Int -> BoardViewerInit
instance (Average c) => Average (Color3 c)
instance Average Word8
