-- | Display a colorized diff between two Haskell values
--   
--   <tt>Debug.Diff</tt> is a quick tool for comparing two Haskell values,
--   as when diagnosing a test failure. It pretty-prints the values (using
--   the <tt>groom</tt> library) and passes them to an external
--   <tt>diff</tt> command (<tt>colordiff</tt> by default), which writes
--   the diff to standard output.
--   
--   <tt>Debug.Diff.Config</tt> provides more control over the diff
--   parameters.
