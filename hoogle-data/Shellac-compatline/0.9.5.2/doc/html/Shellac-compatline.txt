-- | "compatline" backend module for Shellac
--   
--   This package provides a Shellac backend which acts a thin interface
--   for the Shellac-readline or Shellac-editline packages, depending on
--   avaliability. Note that this package may be compiled against readline,
--   which is licended under the GPL.
@package Shellac-compatline
@version 0.9.5.2


-- | This module implements a Shellac backend based either on GNU readline
--   or on libedit. The choice between these two packages is made at
--   compile time, based on avaliability. In the case that both are
--   avaliable, libedit is chosen.
--   
--   Beware that while the code for this Shellac binding is licensed under
--   a BSD3 license, GNU readline itself is licensed under the GPL. This
--   means that your project needs to be GPL compatible to use this
--   backend! Otherwise you may encounter licensing issues.
--   
--   If your project is not GPL compatabile you should instead use the
--   Shellac-editline library, as editline is licensed under a BSD3
--   license.
