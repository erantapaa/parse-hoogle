-- | timer functionality to clock IO commands
--   
--   clocked is a library that allows you to clock IO-operations. You can
--   use it to clock the rendering of frames, the calculation of steps in a
--   physics engine, the triggering of musical events in a real-time
--   system, etc.
@package clocked
@version 0.4.1.3

module Clocked
data Timer

-- | Run a monadic action with a <a>Timer</a>.
withTimer :: MonadCatchIO m => (Timer -> m a) -> m a

-- | Waits the given amount of seconds minus the elapsed time since the
--   last call to <a>waitTimer</a> (or the initialisation of the timer).
waitTimer :: Timer -> Double -> IO ()

-- | returns a monotonic time in seconds
getTimeDouble :: IO Double
