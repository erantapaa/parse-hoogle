-- | Yesod in pure Haskell: no Template Haskell or QuasiQuotes
--   
--   NOTE: Most of the concepts from this package have made it into
--   yesod-core itself since the 1.2 release. Please see
--   <a>http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2013/03/yesod-dispatch-version-1-2</a>
--   for more information, or search the Haddocks for <tt>LiteApp</tt>.
--   
--   Provides helper functions to simplify programming of Yesod without any
--   code generation or non-Haskell DSLs. Mainly, this is focused on the
--   routing quasi-quoter, though some templating help is provided as well.
