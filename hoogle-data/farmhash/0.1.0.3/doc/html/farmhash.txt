module FarmHash

-- | Hash function for a byte array.
--   
--   May change from time to time, and may differ on platforms.
hash :: ByteString -> Word32

-- | Hash function for a byte array. Most useful in 32-bit binaries.
--   
--   May change from time to time, and may differ on platforms.
hash32 :: ByteString -> Word32

-- | Hash function for a byte array. For convenience, a 32-bit seed is also
--   hashed into the result.
--   
--   May change from time to time, and may differ on platforms.
hash32WithSeed :: ByteString -> Word32 -> Word32

-- | Hash function for a byte array.
--   
--   May change from time to time, and may differ on platforms.
hash64 :: ByteString -> Word64

-- | Hash function for a byte array. For convenience, a 64-bit seed is also
--   hashed into the result.
--   
--   May change from time to time, and may differ on platforms.
hash64WithSeed :: ByteString -> Word64 -> Word64

-- | Hash function for a byte array. For convenience, two seeds are also
--   hashed into the result.
--   
--   May change from time to time, and may differ on platforms.
hash64WithSeeds :: ByteString -> Word64 -> Word64 -> Word64

-- | Fingerprint function for a byte array. Most useful in 32-bit binaries.
--   
--   Portable, forever-fixed hash function.
fingerprint32 :: ByteString -> Word32

-- | Fingerprint function for a byte array.
--   
--   Portable, forever-fixed hash function.
