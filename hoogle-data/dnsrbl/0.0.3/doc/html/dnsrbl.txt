-- | Anynchronously lookup a host on multiple DSNRBLs.
module Network.DNSRBL

-- | <a>dorbls</a> is a friendly wrapper around dorblf which only requires
--   a hostname
dorbls :: String -> IO [(String, Bool)]

-- | <a>dorblf</a> returns a list of (String,Bool) where the string is the
--   RBL name and Bool is if it was found or not Note: There may be
--   multiple instances of the same string with different Bool values since
--   one hostname may resolve to multiple IPs some of which may match and
--   some of which may not match
dorblf :: String -> [HostAddress] -> Resolver -> IO [(String, Bool)]

-- | <a>asanequery</a> is a wrapper of dorblf which has only one instance
--   of RBL and if any of the elements were found in the RBL (name, any of
--   the IPs) if it is true otherwise it is false.
asanequery :: String -> [HostAddress] -> Resolver -> IO [(String, Bool)]

-- | <a>sanequery</a> is a Wrapper of <a>dorbls</a> which has only one
--   instance of each RBL and if any of the elements were found in the RBL
--   (name, any of the IPs) it is true, otherwise it is false
