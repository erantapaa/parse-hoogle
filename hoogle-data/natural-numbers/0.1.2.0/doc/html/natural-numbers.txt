-- | Natural numbers
--   
--   This package provides a type of all natural numbers, that is,
--   non-negative integers.
--   
--   In contrast to the <tt>naturals</tt> package, it does not use an
--   “indeterminate value” to represent underflows, but raises errors on
--   underflows. We think this is more reasonable, as this “indeterminate
--   value” is not really a natural.
@package natural-numbers
@version 0.1.2.0


-- | Support for natural numbers.
module Data.Natural

-- | The type of natural numbers.
--   
--   Note that matching a natural number against a negative pattern might
--   not work as you expect. For example, evaluating the following
--   expression results in a run-time error, instead of the result
--   <tt>"plus five"</tt>:
--   
--   <pre>
--   case 5 :: Natural of
--       -5 -&gt; "minus five"
--        5 -&gt; "plus five"
--   </pre>
--   
--   The reason is that the <tt>==</tt> operator of <tt>Natural</tt> is
--   used for checking if the patterns match, making it necessary to
--   convert <tt>-5</tt> to Natural.
data Natural

-- | Yields the monus of two natural numbers, which is their difference if
--   the first number is greater than the second, and zero otherwise.
monus :: Natural -> Natural -> Natural

-- | A data type for views of natural numbers.
data View
Zero :: View
Succ :: Natural -> View

-- | Yields the view of a natural number.
view :: Natural -> View

-- | Folding of natural numbers.
