-- | Literal, uninterpolated here docs
module Data.String.Here.Uninterpolated

-- | Quote a here doc, stripping leading and trailing whitespace
here :: QuasiQuoter

-- | Splice a file's contents as a here doc
hereFile :: QuasiQuoter

-- | Quote a here doc literally, with no whitespace stripping
hereLit :: QuasiQuoter


-- | Interpolated here docs
module Data.String.Here.Interpolated

-- | Quote a here doc with embedded antiquoted expressions
--   
--   Any expression occurring between <tt>${</tt> and <tt>}</tt> (for which
--   the type must have <a>Show</a> and <a>Typeable</a> instances) will be
--   interpolated into the quoted string.
--   
--   Characters preceded by a backslash are treated literally. This enables
--   the inclusion of the literal substring <tt>${</tt> within your quoted
--   text by writing it as <tt>\${</tt>. The literal sequence <tt>\${</tt>
--   may be written as <tt>\\${</tt>.
i :: QuasiQuoter

-- | Like <a>i</a>, but with leading and trailing whitespace trimmed
iTrim :: QuasiQuoter

-- | Quote the contents of a file as with <a>i</a>
--   
--   This enables usage as a simple template engine
template :: QuasiQuoter
