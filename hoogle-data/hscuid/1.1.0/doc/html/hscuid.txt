-- | You can generate a new CUID or slug inside any IO-enabled monad using
--   <a>newCuid</a> and <a>newSlug</a>.
module Web.Cuid

-- | Convenience type so that you don't have to import Text downstream.
--   Note that this is strict Text.
type Cuid = Text

-- | Generate a new random CUID.
newCuid :: MonadIO m => m Cuid

-- | A Slug is not a Cuid. But it is also a strict Text.
type Slug = Text

-- | A slug is a shorter piece of text generated using some of the same
--   techniques as CUIDs.
newSlug :: MonadIO m => m Slug
