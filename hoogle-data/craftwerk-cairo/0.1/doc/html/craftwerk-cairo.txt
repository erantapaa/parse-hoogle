-- | Cairo backend for Craftwerk.
--   
--   Cairo backend for Craftwerk, a high-level and easy to use graphics
--   library with integrated TikZ output.
--   
--   Craftwerk is a high-level 2D vector graphics library for output of
--   TikZ pictures that can be typeset using (pdf)LaTeX. The TikZ library
--   and documentation can be found at:
--   <a>http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf</a>.
--   
--   Craftwerk tries to encapsulate the graphics backend such that figures
--   can also be rendered with a Cairo backend and quickly displayed in a
--   Gtk window. The aim is to support TikZ and Cairo seamlessly as
--   possible, meaning that graphics produced with either backend should
--   look as similar as possible. Other backends are easily written and the
--   aim is to provide generic fallback functions for features that are not
--   natively supported by some backend.
