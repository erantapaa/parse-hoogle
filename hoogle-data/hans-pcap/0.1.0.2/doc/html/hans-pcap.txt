-- | Driver for real ethernet devices for HaNS
--   
--   Network ethernet device for HaNS(Currently requires hans-2.4 from the
--   github), which can tap into a real ethernet interface, all using pcap
--   library and preform raw packet reads &amp; writes. This is a very
--   simple. But requires: root - to be able to use PCAP.
@package hans-pcap
@version 0.1.0.2

module Hans.Device.Pcap

-- | Open device with pcap, will give info about the state, Unless the
--   device is up it will throw errors later Be sure to use fesh mac,
--   otherwise all might fail.
pcapOpen :: String -> IO PcapHandle

-- | send to deviece
pcapSend :: PcapHandle -> ByteString -> IO ()

-- | receive from it
pcapReceiveLoop :: PcapHandle -> EthernetHandle -> IO ()
