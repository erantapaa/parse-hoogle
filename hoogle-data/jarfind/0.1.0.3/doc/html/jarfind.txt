-- | Tool for searching java classes, members and fields in classfiles and JAR archives
--   
--   Search classfiles and JARs: like, all public <a>close</a> methods in
--   classes with <a>Stream</a> in their name in a JAR. Mostly for
--   debugging NoSuchMethodError's etc. resulting from an outdated JAR and
--   alike.
