-- | Reading of Vorbis comments from Ogg Vorbis files
--   
--   This library supports reading of Vorbis comments from Ogg Vorbis
--   files, and will perhaps support writing of such comments in the
--   future; as well as, perhaps, reading/writing Vorbis comments to other
--   file formats (FLAC, Theora, etc).
