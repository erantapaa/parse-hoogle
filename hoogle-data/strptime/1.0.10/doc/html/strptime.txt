-- | Efficient parsing of LocalTime using a binding to C's strptime,
with some extra features (i.e. fractional seconds)
--   
--   This library provides a binding to strptime, that allows to parse
--   dates and times from strings and strict/lazy bytestrings. The library
--   creates LocalTime values. It provides some extra features which the
--   original strptime lacks - parsing of fractional seconds and parsing of
--   ten-powers of seconds since epoch (for example milliseconds since
--   epoch).
@package strptime
@version 1.0.10
