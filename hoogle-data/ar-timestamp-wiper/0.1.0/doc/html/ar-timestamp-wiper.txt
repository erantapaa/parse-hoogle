-- | Wipes time stamps from .a files (like ar -D)
--   
--   This application takes an archive (.a) file as created by the Unix ar
--   tool, and sets all time stamps in it to zero.
--   
--   These time stamps make ar generate different output for same input
--   every time, which is problematic if you want to know if the contents
--   actually changed as compared to the last time you created the archive
--   (e.g. in build tools to avoid unnecessary linking).
--   
--   Recent versions of GNU binutils and BSD ar af the -D flag for
--   deterministic mode that creates the archive with all time stamps set
--   to zero. However, these versions of ar are not wide spread yet, and
--   this tool can help with that.
