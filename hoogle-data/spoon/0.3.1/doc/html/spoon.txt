-- | Catch errors thrown from pure computations.

--   Takes an error-throwing expression and puts it back in the Maybe it

-- | Two functions for catching pureish exceptions in pure values. This
--   library considers pureish to be any error call or undefined, failed
--   pattern matches, arithmetic exceptions, and array bounds exceptions.

-- | Evaluate a value to normal form and return Nothing if any exceptions
