-- | group strings by words in common
--   
--   Given a list of strings, smartGroup provides a set of functions to
--   group them into smaller lists based on the most common words of the
--   set.

-- | Divide list into about n different groups
groupNum :: (Ord a, Splittable s) => Int -> Int -> (a -> s) -> [a] -> [[a]]

-- | Divide list into groups such that the amount of groups equals the log
