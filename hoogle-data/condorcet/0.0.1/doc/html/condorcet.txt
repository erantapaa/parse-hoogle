module Condorcet

-- | Candidates are represented as integers.
type Candidate = Int

-- | Ballots are a ranking of candidates.
--   
--   Ballots are lists, where each element is a list of candidates the rank
--   the same. Earlier entries in the ballot list are ranked higher.
--   
--   E.g., this ballot:
--   
--   <pre>
--   [ [1,3], [4], [2] ]
--   </pre>
--   
--   Means that 1 and 3 are tied for first, outranking 4, and everyone
--   beats 2.
type Ballot = [[Candidate]]

-- | <a>run</a> runs the process, taking a list of <a>Ballot</a>s and
--   returning a list of winning candidates.
run :: [Ballot] -> [Candidate]
