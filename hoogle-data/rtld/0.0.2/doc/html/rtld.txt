-- | dynamic linker tools for Haskell
--   
--   Package <tt>rtld</tt> provides simplistic interface to the dynamic
--   linker/loader. It wraps 'dlopen/dlclose' family of functions
--   ('LoadLibrary/FreeLibrary' on Windows) and tries to provide a common
--   interface to dynamically load foreign libraries at runtime. It is used
--   currently as a helper package for <tt>curlhs</tt>
--   (<a>http://hackage.haskell.org/package/curlhs</a>), but is not ready
--   for the public use (more tests and design decisions needed).
--   
--   Package is distributed under ISC License (MIT/BSD-style, see LICENSE
--   file for details). It is marked as <tt>OtherLicense</tt> due to
--   limitations of Cabal.
