-- | http-client backend using the OpenSSL library.
--   
@package http-client-openssl
@version 0.2.0.1


-- | Support for making connections via the OpenSSL library.
module Network.HTTP.Client.OpenSSL

-- | Note that it is the caller's responsibility to pass in an appropriate
--   context. Future versions of http-client-openssl will hopefully include
--   a sane, safe default.
opensslManagerSettings :: IO SSLContext -> ManagerSettings

-- | Computation of <tt><a>withOpenSSL</a> action</tt> initializes the
--   OpenSSL library as necessary, and computes <tt>action</tt>. Every
--   application that uses HsOpenSSL must wrap any operations involving
--   OpenSSL with <a>withOpenSSL</a>, or they might crash:
--   
--   <pre>
--   module Main where
--   import OpenSSL
--   
--   main :: IO ()
--   main = withOpenSSL $
--          do ...
--   </pre>
--   
--   Since 0.10.3.5, <a>withOpenSSL</a> is safe to be applied redundantly.
--   Library authors may wish to wrap their functions not to force their
--   users to think about initialization:
--   
--   <pre>
--   get :: URI -&gt; IO Response
--   get uri = withOpenSSL $ internalImplementationOfGet uri
--   </pre>
withOpenSSL :: IO a -> IO a
