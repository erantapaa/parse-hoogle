-- | A fault tree analysis library.
--   
--   Fault tree analysis is used to determine probability of failure modes
--   in safety critical applications. Generates fault tree graphs
--   (Graphviz) and calculates cutsets. Yices (required) is the backend SMT
--   solver used for cutset calculation.
