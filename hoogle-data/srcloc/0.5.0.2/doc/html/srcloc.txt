module Data.Loc

-- | Position type.
data Pos

-- | Source file name, line, column, and character offset.
--   
--   Line numbering starts at 1, column offset starts at 1, and character
--   offset starts at 0.
Pos :: !FilePath -> {-# UNPACK #-} !Int -> {-# UNPACK #-} !Int -> {-# UNPACK #-} !Int -> Pos

-- | Position file.
posFile :: Pos -> FilePath

-- | Position line.
posLine :: Pos -> Int

-- | Position column.
posCol :: Pos -> Int

-- | Position character offset.
posCoff :: Pos -> Int

-- | Starting position for given file.
startPos :: FilePath -> Pos

-- | Position corresponding to given file and line.
--   
--   Note that the associated character offset is set to 0.
linePos :: FilePath -> Int -> Pos

-- | Advance a position by a single character. Newlines increment the line
--   number, tabs increase the position column following a tab stop width
--   of 8, and all other characters increase the position column by one.
--   All characters, including newlines and tabs, increase the character
--   offset by 1.
--   
--   Note that <a>advancePos</a> assumes UNIX-style newlines.
advancePos :: Pos -> Char -> Pos

-- | Format a position in a human-readable way, returning an ordinary
--   <a>String</a>.
displayPos :: Pos -> String

-- | Format a position in a human-readable way.
displaySPos :: Pos -> ShowS

-- | Location type, consisting of a beginning position and an end position.
data Loc
NoLoc :: Loc

-- | Beginning and end positions
Loc :: {-# UNPACK #-} !Pos -> {-# UNPACK #-} !Pos -> Loc

-- | Starting position of the location.
locStart :: Loc -> Loc

-- | Ending position of the location.
locEnd :: Loc -> Loc

-- | Merge the locations of two <a>Located</a> values.
(<-->) :: (Located a, Located b) => a -> b -> Loc

-- | Format a location in a human-readable way, returning an ordinary
--   <a>String</a>.
displayLoc :: Loc -> String

-- | Format a location in a human-readable way.
displaySLoc :: Loc -> ShowS

-- | Source location type. Source location are all equal, which allows AST
--   nodes to be compared modulo location information.
newtype SrcLoc
SrcLoc :: Loc -> SrcLoc

-- | The <a>SrcLoc</a> of a <a>Located</a> value.
srclocOf :: Located a => a -> SrcLoc

-- | A <a>SrcLoc</a> with (minimal) span that includes two <a>Located</a>
--   values.
srcspan :: (Located a, Located b) => a -> b -> SrcLoc

-- | Locations
class IsLocation a where fromPos p = fromLoc (Loc p p)
fromLoc :: IsLocation a => Loc -> a
fromPos :: IsLocation a => Pos -> a

-- | No location.
noLoc :: IsLocation a => a

-- | Located values have a location.
class Located a where locOfList xs = mconcat (map locOf xs)
locOf :: Located a => a -> Loc
locOfList :: Located a => [a] -> Loc

-- | Values that can be relocated
class Relocatable a
reloc :: Relocatable a => Loc -> a -> a

-- | A value of type <tt>L a</tt> is a value of type <tt>a</tt> with an
--   associated <a>Loc</a>, but this location is ignored when performing
--   comparisons.
