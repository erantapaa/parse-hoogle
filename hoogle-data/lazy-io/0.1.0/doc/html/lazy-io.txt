-- | Lazy IO
--   
--   The library provides some basic but useful lazy IO functions. Keep in
--   mind that lazy IO is generally discouraged. Perhaps a coroutine
--   library (e.g. pipes) will better suit your needs.
@package lazy-io
@version 0.1.0


-- | The module is intended to be imported qualified:
--   
--   <pre>
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; import qualified Control.Monad.LazyIO as LazyIO
--   </pre>
module Control.Monad.LazyIO

-- | Lazily evaluate each action in the sequence from left to right, and
--   collect the results.
sequence :: [IO a] -> IO [a]

-- | <a>mapM</a> f is equivalent to <a>sequence</a> . <a>map</a> f.
mapM :: (a -> IO b) -> [a] -> IO [b]

-- | <a>forM</a> is <a>mapM</a> with its arguments flipped.
forM :: [a] -> (a -> IO b) -> IO [b]
