-- | Quiver combinators for bytestring streaming
--   
--   This library provides a set of combinators for efficient streaming of
--   bytestring data in the Quiver framework.
@package quiver-bytestring
@version 0.0.0.1


-- | When binary data is streamed through a Quiver processor, it's often
--   partitioned arbitrarily into <i>packets</i> with no semantic
--   significance, beyond facilitation of processing in constant space.
--   This is similar to the chunking mechanism within lazy bytestrings,
--   and, accordingly, it's often convenient to unify the two mechanisms,
--   by converting between processors over lazy bytestrings and processors
--   over strict chunks of these bytestrings. This module provides
--   efficient implementations of these conversions.
module Control.Quiver.ByteString

-- | A processors that converts a stream of lazy bytestrings into a stream
--   of their chunks.
toChunks :: Functor f => SP ByteString ByteString f [ByteString]

-- | A processors that converts a stream of strict bytestring chunks into a
--   stream of lazy bytestrings with the specified minimum and maximum
--   size, without copying any data.
fromChunks :: Functor f => Int64 -> Int64 -> SP ByteString ByteString f [ByteString]
