@package leapseconds-announced
@version 2015.0.0.1


-- | Provides a static <a>LeapSecondTable</a> "containing" the leap seconds
--   announced at library release time. This version will become
--   invalidated when/if the International Earth Rotation and Reference
--   Systems Service (IERS) announces a new leap second at
--   <a>http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat</a>. At that
--   time a new version of the library will be released, against which any
--   code wishing to remain up to date should be recompiled.
--   
--   This module is intended to provide a quick-and-dirty leap second
--   solution for one-off analyses concerned only with the past and present
--   (i.e. up until the next as of yet unannounced leap second), or for
--   applications which can afford to be recompiled against an updated
--   library as often as every six months.
module Data.Time.Clock.AnnouncedLeapSeconds

-- | <a>LeapSecondTable</a> containing all leap seconds from 1972-01-01 to
--   2015-07-01.
