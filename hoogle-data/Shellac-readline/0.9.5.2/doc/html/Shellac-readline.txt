-- | Readline backend module for Shellac
--   
--   This package provides a Shellac backend based on the GNU readline
--   library. This backend features all the line editing capabilities
--   provided by readline, as well as command completion and command
--   history features.
@package Shellac-readline
@version 0.9.5.2


-- | This module implements a Shellac backend based on the GNU readline and
--   GNU history modules. For readline, we use the bindings from the
--   standard library. For history, we import directily using FFI. This
--   Shellac backend supports command completion, history buffer and all
--   the line editing and character binding features of GNU readline.
--   
--   Beware that while the code for this Shellac binding is licensed under
--   a BSD3 license, GNU readline itself is licensed under the GPL. This
--   means that your project needs to be GPL compatible for this Shellac
--   backend to be useful to you.
