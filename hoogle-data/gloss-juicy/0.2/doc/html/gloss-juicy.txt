@package gloss-juicy
@version 0.2

module Graphics.Gloss.Juicy

-- | Tries to convert a <a>DynamicImage</a> from JuicyPixels to a gloss
--   <a>Picture</a>. All formats except RGBF and YF should successfully
--   yield a <a>Picture</a>.
fromDynamicImage :: DynamicImage -> Maybe Picture

-- | O(N) conversion from <a>PixelRGBA8</a> image to gloss <a>Picture</a>,
--   where N is the number of pixels.
fromImageRGBA8 :: Image PixelRGBA8 -> Picture

-- | Creation of a gloss <a>Picture</a> by promoting (through
--   <a>promoteImage</a>) the <a>PixelRGB8</a> image to <a>PixelRGBA8</a>
--   and calling <a>fromImageRGBA8</a>.
fromImageRGB8 :: Image PixelRGB8 -> Picture

-- | Creation of a gloss <a>Picture</a> by promoting (through
--   <a>promoteImage</a>) the <tt>PixelY8</tt> image to <a>PixelRGBA8</a>
--   and calling <a>fromImageRGBA8</a>.
fromImageY8 :: Image Pixel8 -> Picture

-- | Creation of a gloss <a>Picture</a> by promoting (through
--   <a>promoteImage</a>) the <a>PixelYA8</a> image to <a>PixelRGBA8</a>
--   and calling <a>fromImageRGBA8</a>.
fromImageYA8 :: Image PixelYA8 -> Picture

-- | Creation of a gloss <a>Picture</a> by promoting (through
--   <a>promoteImage</a>) the <a>PixelYCbCr8</a> image to <a>PixelRGBA8</a>
--   and calling <a>fromImageRGBA8</a>.
fromImageYCbCr8 :: Image PixelYCbCr8 -> Picture

-- | Tries to load an image file into a Picture using <a>readImage</a> from
--   JuicyPixels. It means it'll try to successively read the content as an
--   image in the following order, until it succeeds (or fails on all of
--   them): jpeg, png, bmp, gif, hdr (the last two are not supported) This
--   is handy when you don't know what format the image contained in the
--   file is encoded with. If you know the format in advance, use
--   <a>loadBMP</a>, <a>loadJuicyJPG</a> or <a>loadJuicyPNG</a>
loadJuicy :: FilePath -> IO (Maybe Picture)
loadJuicyJPG :: FilePath -> IO (Maybe Picture)

-- | Load an uncompressed 24 or 32bit RGBA BMP file as a bitmap.
