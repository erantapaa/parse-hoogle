-- | Binding for the rdtsc machine instruction
--   
@package rdtsc
@version 1.3.0.1


-- | This module provides the function "rdtsc" for accessing the rdtsc
--   machine register on modern IA-32 processors. This is a 64-bit counter
--   which counts the number of processor cycles since the machine has been
--   powered up.
--   
--   As an example, you may use the following program to measure the
--   overhead of calling this function:
--   
--   <pre>
--   module Main where
--   import System.CPUTime.Rdtsc
--   
--   main = do
--     t1 &lt;- rdtsc
--     t2 &lt;- rdtsc
--     putStrLn ("Cost of rdtsc (ffi call):    " ++ show (t2 - t1))
--   </pre>
module System.CPUTime.Rdtsc

-- | Return the number of clock cycles since the machine this function is
--   called on has been powered up. Note that the value returned may be
--   inaccurate if the program is run on some hardware virtualization
--   layer.
--   
--   Especially on multi-core processors and when using hibernating
--   operating systems, the values returned may be bogus.
--
