-- | Database versioning and migration (experimental)
--   
--   A database versioning and migration library.
--   
--   <i>Note</i>: This library is under heavy development, currently the
--   PostgreSQL implementation is functional, but expected to change. It is
--   intended that a type safe migration api, command line tools and MySql
--   support be added before this library will be considered stable.
