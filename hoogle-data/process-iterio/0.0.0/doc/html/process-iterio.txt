-- | A library for enumerating OS process input and output with IterIO's
--   stream transformers.
module Data.IterIO.Process

-- | Create an Onum that starts and executable at the given FilePath,
--   passing it args, and routing the process's stdout to the Onum's output
--   stream. If the executable fails, an exception is thrown with the
--   contents of stderr.

-- | Create an Inum that starts and executable at the given FilePath, and
--   passing it args. The Inum's input stream is routed to stdin, and
--   stdout goes to the Inum's output stream. If the executable fails, an
--   exception is thrown with the contents of stderr.
