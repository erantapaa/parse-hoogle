-- | Finding out the full path of the executable.
--   
--   The documentation of <a>System.Environment.getProgName</a> says that
--   "However, this is hard-to-impossible to implement on some non-Unix
--   OSes, so instead, for maximum portability, we just return the leafname
--   of the program as invoked." This library tries to provide the missing
--   path.

-- | The documentation of <a>System.Environment.getProgName</a> says that
--   
--   "However, this is hard-to-impossible to implement on some non-Unix
--   OSes, so instead, for maximum portability, we just return the leafname
--   of the program as invoked. Even then there are some differences
--   between platforms: on Windows, for example, a program invoked as foo
--   is probably really FOO.EXE, and that is what <a>getProgName</a> will
--   return."
--   
--   This library tries to fix this issue. It also provides some
--   platform-specific functions (most notably getting the path of the
--   application bundle on OSX). Supported operating systems:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>Win32 (tested on Windows XP / x86 only)</li>
--   <li>Mac OS X (tested on Leopard / x86 only)</li>
--   <li>Linux</li>
--   <li>FreeBSD (tested on FreeBSD 6.4)</li>
--   <li>*BSD (with procfs mounted, plus fallback for certain shells;
--   untested)</li>
--   <li>Solaris (untested, and probably works on Solaris 10 only)</li>
--   </ul>
