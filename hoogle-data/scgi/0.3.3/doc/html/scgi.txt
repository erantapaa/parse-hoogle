-- | A Haskell library for writing SCGI programs.
--   
--   THIS LIBRARY IS DEPRECATED. For new applications, please use WAI - see
--   <a>http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai</a>.
--   
--   This library lets you write SCGI programs. This package reuses the cgi
--   package API, making it very easy to port CGI programs to SCGI.
@package scgi
