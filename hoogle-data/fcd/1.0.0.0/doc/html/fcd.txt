-- | Compute the length of the longest common subsequence of two lists.
--   This is a simple implementation with memoization that uses quadratic
--   space (O(n*m) where n and m are the length of the inputs). Note: a
--   possible optimization would be to cache the memoized matrix as a lot
--   of it is still relevant when a new character is added.
