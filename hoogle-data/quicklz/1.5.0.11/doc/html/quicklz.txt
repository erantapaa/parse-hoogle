-- | QuickLZ compression for ByteStrings
--   
--   This package provides a high level binding to the QuickLZ compression
--   library for <tt>ByteStrings</tt>, under the GPLv2 license. QuickLZ is
--   fast and compresses very well. Check out the home page:
--   <a>http://quicklz.com</a>
--   
--   This package includes the QuickLZ 1.5.0 source code, at compression
--   level 1 and streaming mode disabled.
--   
--   The versioning scheme for this package is unusual. QuickLZ tries to be
--   as fast as possible, and will break backwards compatibility to achieve
--   it in newer versions. This versioning scheme reflects the QuickLZ
--   versioning scheme: the first three digits of version w.x.y.z are the
--   quicklz version, with the <a>z</a> component (and any further needed
--   ones) being updates to this package, not quicklz itself.

-- | This module provides a high level <tt>ByteString</tt> interface to the
--   QuickLZ library. More information about quicklz can be found here:

--   
--   QuickLZ is fast and compresses well. The library that is bundled with
--   this version is QuickLZ v1.5.0, with the compression level set to 1.
