-- | GTK+ Serialized event.
--   
--   For communicate GTK+ event in multi-processes GTK+ program, we can use
--   <a>serializeEvent</a> serialized event at *server* process, then pass
--   serialized event over the network, when *client* process receive
--   serialized event from the network, we can use <a>deserializeEvent
--   serializedEvent mainDoEvent</a> re-emit same event at *client* side.
