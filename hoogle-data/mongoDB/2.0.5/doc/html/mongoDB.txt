-- | This module defines a connection interface. It could be a regular
--   network connection, TLS connection, a mock or anything else.
module Database.MongoDB.Internal.Connection

-- | Abstract connection interface
--   
--   <a>read</a> should return <a>null</a> on EOF
data Connection
Connection :: IO ByteString -> (ByteString -> IO ()) -> (ByteString -> IO ()) -> IO () -> IO () -> Connection

unread :: Connection -> ByteString -> IO ()

-- | Pipelining is sending multiple requests over a socket and receiving
--   the responses later in the same order (a' la HTTP pipelining). This is
--   faster than sending one request, waiting for the response, then
--   sending the next request, and so on. This implementation returns a
--   <i>promise (future)</i> response for each request that when invoked
--   waits for the response if not already arrived. Multiple threads can
--   send on the same pipeline (and get promises back); it will send each
--   thread's request right away without waiting.
--   
--   A pipeline closes itself when a read or write causes an error, so you
--   can detect a broken pipeline by checking isClosed. It also closes
--   itself when garbage collected, or you can close it explicitly.

--   invoked any number of times, as may be appropriate.
type MapFun = Javascript

-- | <tt>(key, [value]) -&gt; value</tt>. The reduce function receives a
--   key and an array of values and returns an aggregate result value. The
--   MapReduce engine may invoke reduce functions iteratively; thus, these
--   functions must be idempotent. That is, the following must hold for
--   your reduce function: <tt>reduce(k, [reduce(k,vs)]) ==
--   reduce(k,vs)</tt>. If you need to perform an operation only once, use
--   a finalize function. The output of emit (the 2nd param) and reduce
--   should be the same format to make iterative reduce possible.
type ReduceFun = Javascript

-- | <tt>(key, value) -&gt; final_value</tt>. A finalize function may be
--   run after reduction. Such a function is optional and is not necessary
--   for many map/reduce cases. The finalize function takes a key and a
--   value, and returns a finalized value.
