@package heapsort
@version 0.1.0


-- | This module provides heapsort for an <a>MArray</a> with indices of
--   <a>Integral</a> type. See any good algorithms text for a description
--   of heapsort. Heapsort is O(n lg n) comparisons and exchanges in the
--   worst case, and is reasonably efficient.
module Data.Array.MArray.Heapsort

-- | Sort the elements of the given <a>MArray</a> in increasing order.
sort :: (Integral i, Ix i, Ord e, MArray a e m) => a i e -> m ()
