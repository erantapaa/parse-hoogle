-- | Parallel execution of monadic computations
--   
@package monad-parallel
@version 0.7.1.4


-- | This module defines classes of monads that can perform multiple
--   computations in parallel and, more importantly, combine the results of
--   those parallel computations.
--   
--   There are two classes exported by this module, <a>MonadParallel</a>
--   and <a>MonadFork</a>. The former is more generic, but the latter is
--   easier to use: when invoking any expensive computation that could be
--   performed in parallel, simply wrap the call in <a>forkExec</a>. The
--   function immediately returns a handle to the running computation. The
--   handle can be used to obtain the result of the computation when
--   needed:
--   
--   <pre>
--   do child &lt;- forkExec expensive
--      otherStuff
--      result &lt;- child
--   </pre>
--   
--   In this example, the computations <i>expensive</i> and
--   <i>otherStuff</i> would be performed in parallel. When using the
--   <a>MonadParallel</a> class, both parallel computations must be
--   specified at once:
--   
--   <pre>
--   bindM2 (\ childResult otherResult -&gt; ...) expensive otherStuff
--   </pre>
--   
--   In either case, for best results the costs of the two computations
--   should be roughly equal.
--   
--   Any monad that is an instance of the <a>MonadFork</a> class is also an
--   instance of the <a>MonadParallel</a> class, and the following law
--   should hold:
--   
--   <pre>
--   bindM2 f ma mb = do {a' &lt;- forkExec ma; b &lt;- mb; a &lt;- a'; f a b}
--   </pre>
--   
--   When operating with monads free of side-effects, such as
--   <a>Identity</a> or <a>Maybe</a>, <a>forkExec</a> is equivalent to
--   <a>return</a> and <a>bindM2</a> is equivalent to <tt> \ f ma mb -&gt;
--   do {a &lt;- ma; b &lt;- mb; f a b} </tt> â€” the only difference is in
--   the resource utilisation. With the <a>IO</a> monad, on the other hand,
--   there may be visible difference in the results because the side
--   effects of <i>ma</i> and <i>mb</i> may be arbitrarily reordered.
