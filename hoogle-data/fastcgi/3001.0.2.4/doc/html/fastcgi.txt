-- | A Haskell library for writing FastCGI programs
--   
--   This library lets you write FastCGI programs. This package reuses the
--   cgi package API, making it very easy to port CGI programs to FastCGI.
--   The FastCGI C development kit is required to build this library.
@package fastcgi
@version 3001.0.2.4


-- | Interface for FastCGI <a>http://fastcgi.com/</a>, using the fcgiapp
--   API.
module Network.FastCGI

-- | Handle a single CGI request, or FastCGI requests in an infinite loop.
--   This function only returns normally if it was a CGI request. This lets
--   you use the same program as either a FastCGI or CGI program, depending
--   on what the server treats it as.
runFastCGIorCGI :: CGI CGIResult -> IO ()

-- | Handle a single FastCGI or CGI request. This lets you use the same
--   program as either a FastCGI or CGI program, depending on what the
--   server treats it as.
runOneFastCGIorCGI :: CGI CGIResult -> IO Bool

-- | Handle FastCGI requests in an infinite loop.
runFastCGI :: CGI CGIResult -> IO ()

-- | Handle a single FastCGI request.
runOneFastCGI :: CGI CGIResult -> IO ()

-- | Like <a>runCGI</a>, but uses the FastCGI interface and forks off a new
--   thread (using <a>forkOS</a>) for every request.
runFastCGIConcurrent :: Int -> CGI CGIResult -> IO ()
runFastCGIConcurrent' :: (IO () -> IO a) -> Int -> CGI CGIResult -> IO ()
