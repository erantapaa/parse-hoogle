-- | Interface to random.org
--   
--   Using this package you can generate random numbers, strings and
--   randomize a sequence of numbers through the random.org website, which
--   provides randomness through atmospheric noise rather than a PRNG.
@package RandomDotOrg
@version 0.2.1

module System.Random.Atmosphere

-- | Used to get a list of random numbers from http:<i></i>random.org.
--   Note: the minimum must be greater than the maximum. The maximum amount
--   of numbers you can retrieve is 10,000, and the numbers themselves are
--   limited to a range of +/- 1,000,000,000 (inclusive)
getRandomNumbers :: Int -> Int -> Int -> IO (Either String [Int])

-- | This is just like <a>getRandomNumbers</a>, but instead it will
--   randomize a given interval of integers. The limits on the
--   minimum/maximum are -1e9 to 1e9, inclusive. The interval itself must
--   be less than 10,000.
getRandomSequence :: Int -> Int -> IO (Either String [Int])

-- | Generate random strings. NOTE: if you specify to generate unique
--   strings, the amount you want to retrieve <i>must</i> be less than or
--   equal to the amount of strings that exist within the character set you
--   specify. In the future there will be a check for this, but you have to
--   be sure as of right now.
getRandomStrings :: Int -> Int -> Bool -> Bool -> Bool -> Bool -> IO (Either String [String])

-- | Used to check how much of your random.org quota you have. Please see
--   <a>http://random.org/quota</a> for more info.
