-- | Detect which OS you're running on.
--   
--   This package lets you easily query various facts about the system that
--   your code is running on. Currently, it reports whether the operating
--   system is "Windows" or "Unix", and also the name and version of the
--   Haskell compiler used.
--   
--   This package implements lots of complicated trickery to determine the
--   build environment. Once built, other packages can query this
--   information without needing to do complex trickery themselves.
--   
--   See also the included <tt>ReadMe.xhtml</tt> file.
--   
--   Changes:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>If the configure step fails to detect the OS type, the configure
--   step now <i>fails</i>.</li>
--   <li>A new file <tt>Manual.hs</tt> allows you to override the
--   auto-detected platform values with whatever you want. (See
--   <tt>ReadMe.xhtml</tt> for details.)</li>
--   <li>All the platform queries no longer return <tt>Maybe</tt> values.
--   (This breaks API compatibility, hence the version bump.)</li>
--   </ul>
@package AC-BuildPlatform
@version 1.1.0


-- | Query basic properties of the current platform.
--   
--   All of these values are compile-time constants. If the special magic
--   in the package configure step was unable to determine the correct
--   value for something, it comes back as <a>Nothing</a>.
