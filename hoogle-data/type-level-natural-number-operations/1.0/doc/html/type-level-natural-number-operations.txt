-- | Basic operations on type-level natural numbers.
--   
--   This package provides some basic operations that do not require the
--   UndecideableInstances extension on type-level natural numbers.
--   Specifically, this package provides the Plus and Minus type functions.
@package type-level-natural-number-operations
@version 1.0

module TypeLevel.NaturalNumber.Operations

-- | The <a>Plus</a> type family provides a function that adds two
--   type-level natural numbers. This function is implemented by induction
--   on the first argument --- a fact that one should be aware of when
--   using it in function signatures.

-- | The <a>Plus</a> type family provides a function that subtracts two
--   type-level natural numbers. This function is implemented by induction
--   on both arguments, with the base case being when the second argument
--   is Zero.
