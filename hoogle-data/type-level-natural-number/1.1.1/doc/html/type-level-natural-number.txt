-- | Simple, Haskell 2010-compatible type level natural numbers
--   
--   This is a simple, Haskell 2010 compatible implementation of type-level
--   natural numbers. Operations requiring non-Haskell 2010 language
--   extensions have been split into a separate package.
--   
--   The difference between this package and the many others on Hackage
--   implementing type-level naturals is its emphasis on simplicity. It
--   only supports non-negative natural numbers, and only the successor and
--   predicessor operations. It represents natural numbers using a
--   type-level linked list, so it is not intended to be used for
--   representing large numbers. Pre-defined aliases for natural numbers up
--   to 15 are provided.
--   
--   The code for this package was largely taken from the excellent Vec
--   package; I created this package with the intent of making this
--   functionality more widely available.
--   
--   Difference from 1.0: Added instances for Typeable, and word synonyms
--   for N0...N15.
--   
--   Difference from 1.1: Performance enhancements for naturalNumberAsInt.
--   Simplified Show implementation.
