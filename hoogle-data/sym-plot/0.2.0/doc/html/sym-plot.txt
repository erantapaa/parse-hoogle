-- | Plot permutations; an addition to the sym package
--   
--   This packade adds plots to the sym package. It has been factored out
--   of that package because diagrams is a rather heavy dependency.
@package sym-plot
@version 0.2.0


-- | Plot permutations.
module Math.Sym.Plot

-- | A plot is represented by Cairo diagram
type Plot = Diagram Cairo R2

-- | The plot of a permutation.
plotPerm :: Permutation a => a -> Plot

-- | The plot of a list of permutations. The first argument specifies how
--   many permutations are on each row.
plotPerms :: Permutation a => Int -> [a] -> Plot

-- | Save plot as a png, ps, pdf, or svg (determined automatically from the
--   file extension).
savePlot :: Double -> String -> Plot -> IO ()
