-- | Bindings to CityHash
--   
--   This package implements a binding to the CityHash family of hashing
--   functions (implemented in C++.)
--   
--   See <a>http://code.google.com/p/cityhash/</a> for more information.
--   
--   This package has optional SSE4.2 support. If you build it with the
--   <tt>-fsse42</tt> flag, the 128-bit hashing functions will use an
--   SSE-optimized implementation (which takes advantage of the
--   <tt>crc32</tt> instruction present on recent Intel/AMD machines.) The
--   64-bit hashing functions are unaffected.

@version 0.3.0.1


-- | This module implements a binding to the CityHash family of hashing
--   functions. You can find more information here:
--   <a>http://code.google.com/p/cityhash/</a>. It implements both the
--   64-bit and 128-bit interfaces, with seed functionality.
module Data.Digest.CityHash

-- | Hash function for a byte array.
cityHash64 :: ByteString -> Word64

-- | Hash function for a byte array. For convenience, a 64-bit seed is also
--   hashed into the result.
cityHash64WithSeed :: ByteString -> Word64 -> Word64

-- | Hash function for a byte array. For convenience, two seeds are also
--   hashed into the result.
cityHash64WithSeeds :: ByteString -> Word64 -> Word64 -> Word64

-- | Hash function for a byte array.
cityHash128 :: ByteString -> Word128

-- | Hash function for a byte array. For convenience, a 128-bit seed is
--   also hashed into the result.
