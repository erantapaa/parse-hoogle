-- | Library for reading Subversion dump files
--   
--   A library for parsing Subversion dump files. The objective is to
--   convert a dump file into a series of data structures representing that
--   same information. It uses <a>Data.ByteString.Lazy</a> to reading the
--   file, and <a>Data.Text</a> to represent text fields which may contain
--   Unicode characters.
