-- | Non-Determinism Monad for Tree Search

-- | This Haskell library provides an implementation of the MonadPlus type
--   class that represents the search space as a tree whose constructors
--   represent mzero, return, and mplus.
--   
--   Such a tree can be used to implement different search strategies,
--   e.g., by using a queue. It can also be used as a basis for parallel
--   search strategies that evaluate different parts of the search space
--   concurrently.
module Control.Monad.SearchTree

-- | The type <tt>SearchTree a</tt> represents non-deterministic
--   computations as a tree structure.
data SearchTree a
None :: SearchTree a
One :: a -> SearchTree a
Choice :: (SearchTree a) -> (SearchTree a) -> SearchTree a

-- | Another search monad based on continuations that produce search trees.
data Search a

-- | Computes the <tt>SearchTree</tt> representation of a <tt>Search</tt>
--   action.
