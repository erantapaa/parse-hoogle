-- | Unified interface to unsafe functions
--   
--   SafeHaskell introduced the notion of safe and unsafe modules. In order
--   to make as many as possible modules "safe", the well-known unsafe
--   functions were moved to distinguished modules. This makes it hard to
--   write packages that work with both old and new versions of GHC. This
--   package provides a single module <tt>System.Unsafe</tt> that exports
--   the unsafe functions from the base package. It provides them in a
--   style ready for qualification, that is, you should import them by
--   
--   <pre>
--   import qualified System.Unsafe as Unsafe
--   </pre>
--   
--   The package also contains a script called <tt>rename-unsafe.sh</tt>.
--   It replaces all occurrences of the original identifiers with the
--   qualified identifiers from this package. You still have to adapt the
--   import commands. It uses the <tt>darcs-replace-rec</tt> script from
--   the <tt>darcs-scripts</tt> package.
