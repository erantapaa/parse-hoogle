-- | Use this module to stream directory contents lazily in constant memory
--   in conjunction with <tt>pipes</tt>
module Data.DirStream

-- | Select all immediate children of the given directory, ignoring
--   <tt>"."</tt> and <tt>".."</tt>.
--   
--   Returns zero children if the directory is not readable or (on Windows)
--   if the directory is actually a reparse point.
childOf :: MonadSafe m => FilePath -> ListT m FilePath

-- | Select all recursive descendents of the given directory
descendentOf :: MonadSafe m => FilePath -> ListT m FilePath

-- | Determine if a file is visible according to Unix conventions, defined
--   as the base name not beginning with a <tt>'.'</tt>
unixVisible :: FilePath -> Bool

-- | Check if a directory exists at the given path.
--   
--   Symbolic links are resolved to their targets before checking their
--   type.
--   
--   This computation does not throw exceptions.
