-- | The perceptron learning algorithm.
--   
--   This package provides a straightforward implementation of the
--   perceptron learning algorithm for supervised binary linear
--   classification.
@package perceptron
@version 0.1.0.3


-- | An implementation of the perceptron learning algorithm for supervised
--   binary linear classification.
--   
--   A binary classifier maps so-called feature vectors to Boolean values.
--   In the case of linear binary classification the decision on what
--   Boolean a vector is mapped to is based on the value of a linear
--   combination of the vector's components. The perceptron is an online
--   algorithm for learning such a linear mapping from a set of training
--   data.
--   
--   Training data are provided as samples consisting of a feature vector
--   and the Boolean it should be mapped to. Hence, the perceptron
--   implements a form of supervised learning. Only if the training vectors
--   are linearly separable, the perceptron algorithm is guaranteed to
--   terminate.
module Learning.Perceptron

-- | Return a classifier that agrees with the given list of
--   classifications. <i>Only terminates if the given classifications are
--   linearly separable!</i>
