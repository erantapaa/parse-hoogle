-- | The <a>Maybe</a> type encapsulates an optional value. A value of type
--   <tt><a>Maybe</a> a</tt> either contains a value of type <tt>a</tt>
--   (represented as <tt><a>Just</a> a</tt>), or it is empty (represented
--   as <a>Nothing</a>). Using <a>Maybe</a> is a good way to deal with
--   errors or exceptional cases without resorting to drastic measures such
--   as <a>error</a>.
--   
--   The <a>Maybe</a> type is also a monad. It is a simple kind of error
--   monad, where all errors are represented by <a>Nothing</a>. A richer
--   error monad can be built using the <a>Either</a> type.
