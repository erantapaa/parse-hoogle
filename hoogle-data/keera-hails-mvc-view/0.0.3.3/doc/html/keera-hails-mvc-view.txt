-- | Haskell on Gtk rails - Generic View for MVC applications

@package keera-hails-mvc-view
@version 0.0.3.3


-- | This class encapsulates GUI apis with some basic common operations:
--   initialise the GUI, destroy the GUI, execute in the GUI Thread, etc.
module Hails.MVC.View

-- | Null is a parametric datatype with a non-parametric constructor.
data Null a
Null :: Null a

-- | A Class for View (GUI) managers. GUI managers usually have similar
--   operations: initialise, destroy, run operation in the GUI thread, etc.
--   This class encapsulates all these operations to provide a unique
--   interface.
class View a
initView :: View a => Null a -> IO ()
createView :: View a => IO a
startView :: View a => a -> IO ()
onViewSync :: View a => a -> IO b -> IO b
onViewAsync :: View a => a -> IO () -> IO ()
destroyView :: View a => a -> IO ()

-- | An Element Accessor to access elements of kind b from Views of kind a
--   is a function that takes an a and returns a b.
--   
--   This type is defined to make signatures shorter and more declarative.
type ViewElementAccessor a b = a -> b

-- | An Element Accessor to access elements of kind b from Views of kind a
--   is a function that takes an a and returns an IO b.
--   
--   This is the IO counterpart of the previous type. It is used more often
--   because most element accessors run inside the IO monad.
type ViewElementAccessorIO a b = ViewElementAccessor a (IO b)
