-- | Library to switch to daemon mode using built-in OS facilities.
--   
--   This package is a wrapper around the daemon() function on BSD-like
--   Unices, including Mac OS X and glibc-based Linux distributions. It
--   does not function on other systems.
--   
--   Version 3.1 adds the ability to do something after forking but before
--   dropping privileges. It also no longer uses the system-provided
--   daemon() function, which is highly unfortunate but necessary with the
--   RTS's use of per-process timers.
--   
--   Version 3.0.0.1 updates this documentation to be properly broken into
--   paragraphs.
--   
--   Version 3.0 cleans up the parameters structure.
--   
--   Version 2.0 fixes compatibility problems with the threaded GHC
--   runtime. Doing this required two non-backwards-compatible API changes.
--   First, the daemonize function now takes an action to perform as a
--   daemon, and never returns. Second, the functionality of closing all
--   open files has been removed, as it caused crashes. As a substitute,
--   the option of closing only the three standard streams has been added
--   and made the default.
--   
--   Version 1.0 was the initial release.
