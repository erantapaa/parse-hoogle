-- | An interface to the philosophical and metaphysical "now"
--   
--   The ancient greek philosopher Parmenides provided a proof that change
--   is impossible. It therefore stands to reason that there is only one
--   moment in time, and it never changes. This library provides an
--   interface to that moment, allowing it to be used in computations.
@package acme-now
@version 1.0.0.1

module Acme.Time.Now

-- | The unchanging "now". If you get any errors or unexpecting results
--   from using this value, it's because your assumptions about the nature
--   of time are wrong. I have a proof of this, but the margin isn't large
--   enough to contain it.
