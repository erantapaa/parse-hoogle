@package Munkres-simple
@version 0.1.0.1


-- | A simple and typesafe layer over <a>Data.Algorithm.Munkres</a>.
module Data.Algorithm.Munkres.Simple

-- | An association problem, consisting of two sets of items, and a weight
--   function between them. Construct with <a>problem</a>.
data Problem a b

-- | Constructs an association problem, checking whether the sets of
--   objects are the same size first.
problem :: (Ord a, Ord b) => Set a -> Set b -> (a -> b -> Double) -> Problem a b

-- | The solution of an association problem.
data Solution a b

-- | Solve an association problem.
solve :: (Ord a, Ord b) => Problem a b -> Solution a b

-- | In a solution of type <tt>Solution a b</tt>, finds the <tt>a</tt> that
--   a given <tt>b</tt> is paired with. Returns <tt>Nothing</tt> if the
--   given <tt>b</tt> was not a part of the initial problem.
associatedA :: (Ord a, Ord b) => Solution a b -> b -> Maybe a

-- | In a solution of type <tt>Solution a b</tt>, finds the <tt>b</tt> that
--   a given <tt>a</tt> is paired with. Returns <tt>Nothing</tt> if the
--   given <tt>a</tt> was not a part of the initial problem.
associatedB :: (Ord a, Ord b) => Solution a b -> a -> Maybe b

-- | A list of the pairs of items in a solution.
associationList :: Solution a b -> [(a, b)]
