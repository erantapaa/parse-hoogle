-- | Haskell binding to L-BFGS-B version 3.0
--   
--   Haskell bindings to Nocedal's 3.0 version of the Limited memory -
--   Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno - Bounded optimization algorithm.
--   
--   Initial version, but functional. So far no support for limiting
--   iteration count. A more powerful interface should be developed.
--   
--   Notice: The fortran code is marked pure, althugh it tends to write to
--   standard output at troubled times (should be fixed at some point in
--   time).
--   
--   From homepage: Software for Large-scale Bound-constrained Optimization
--   L-BFGS-B is a limited-memory quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained
--   optimization, i.e. for problems where the only constraints are of the
--   form l &lt;= x &lt;= u. The current release is version 3.0. The
--   distribution file was last changed on 2011-08-02.
