-- | A highlight formatter takes a regular expression used to scan the text
--   and an attribute to assign to matches. The regular expression is only
--   applied to individual string tokens (individual words, whitespace
--   strings, etc.); it is NOT applied to whole lines, paragraphs, or text
--   spanning multiple lines. If you have need of that kind of
--   functionality, apply your own attributes with your own regular
--   expression prior to calling <tt>setTextWithAttrs</tt>.
