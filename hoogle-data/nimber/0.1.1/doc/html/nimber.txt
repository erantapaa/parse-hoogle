-- | An implementation of (finite) nimbers
--   
--   This library provides a method to do arithmetic on nimbers, which may
--   be considered an alternative field over the non-negative integers (the
--   general case of transfinite ordinal nimbers is not implementented.)
--   Note that division is extremely slow at this point, due to the lack of
--   a closed-form implementation.
@package nimber
@version 0.1.1


-- | This is an implementation of the nimbers, which are technically a
--   field over the non-negative ordinals, but in this case are restricted
--   to the non-negative integers. Note that division by n is speedy for n
--   &lt; 16, about one second for n &lt; 256, about a minute for n &lt;
--   65535, and probably very, very, very slow for n &gt;= 65535.
