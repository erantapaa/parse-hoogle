-- | Fixed versions of instances reification functions

@package th-instance-reification
@version 0.1.4


-- | Fixed versions of <a>reifyInstances</a> and <a>isInstance</a> as per
--   the following ghc issue:
--   <a>https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7066</a>.
module THInstanceReification

-- | Same as <a>reifyInstances</a>, but also checks the constraints.
reifyProperInstances :: Name -> [Type] -> Q [InstanceDec]

-- | Same as <a>isInstance</a>, but also checks the constraints.
isProperInstance :: Name -> [Type] -> Q Bool

-- | Analyze the constraints of the provided instance dec to be satisfied
--   by the provided types.
--   
--   Note that this function does not analyze the equality constraints
--   (<tt>F a ~ Bool</tt>). It simply considers them to be true.
