--   Generates images suitable for use as CAPTCHAs in online web-form
--   security. Does not integrate with any web framework; simply exports a
--   function that creates the image itself as a ByteString (containing a
--   PNG), and the correct answer to the challenge as a String. HS-Captcha
--   is designed to be as simple as possible to integrate in other
--   frameworks.
