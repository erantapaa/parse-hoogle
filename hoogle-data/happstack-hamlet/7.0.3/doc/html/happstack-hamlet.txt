-- | This module provides support for using Hamlet with Happstack. Hamlet
--   provides type-safe HTML generation. More information can be found at
--   <a>http://patch-tag.com/r/mae/happstack/snapshot/current/content/pretty/happstack-hamlet/demo.hs</a>

module Happstack.Server.Hamlet

-- | turn a <tt>Hamlet</tt> template into a Happstack <a>Response</a>
--   
--   Due to changes in Hamlet, this function is now just defined as:
--   
--   <pre>
--   hamletToResponse showFn hamlet = toResponse $ hamlet showFn
--   </pre>
--   
--   You probably do not need to use this library at all these days.
