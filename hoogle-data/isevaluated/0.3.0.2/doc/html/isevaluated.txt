-- | Check whether a value has been evaluated
--   
--   An IO action to check whether some value has been evaluated.
--   
--   If isEvaluated returns True, evaluating it to weak-head normal form
--   won't throw exceptions and take constant time.
@package isevaluated
@version 0.3.0.2


-- | <a>isEvaluated</a> allows checking for expressions that have already
--   been reduced to weak heaf normal form. This can be useful for racing
--   computations against one another; if one computation can be shown to
--   terminate instantly, there's no need to set up any threads for the
--   race.
module Data.IsEvaluated

-- | If <tt>isEvaluated a</tt> returns <a>True</a>, the given value is in
--   whnf.
--   
--   It may produce false negatives.
