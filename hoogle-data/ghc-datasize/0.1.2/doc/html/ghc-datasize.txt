module GHC.DataSize

-- | Calculate size of GHC objects in Bytes. Note that an object may not be
--   evaluated yet and only the size of the initial closure is returned.
closureSize :: Num b => a -> IO b

-- | Calculate the recursive size of GHC objects in Bytes. Note that the
--   actual size in memory is calculated, so shared values are only counted
--   once.
--   
--   Call with <tt> recursiveSize $! 2 </tt> to force evaluation to WHNF
--   before calculating the size.
--   
--   Call with <tt> recursiveSize $!! "foobar" </tt> ($!! from
--   Control.DeepSeq) to force full evaluation before calculating the size.
--   
--   A garbage collection is performed before the size is calculated,
--   because the garbage collector would make heap walks difficult.
