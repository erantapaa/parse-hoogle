-- | Cross-platform access to a list of words
--   
--   This is a simple wrapper around getting a list of words, that works in
--   a common across multiple platforms.
@package words
@version 0.1.2


-- | This module exposes collections of words in a best guess of the
--   current language on the computer the application is running on.
--   
--   For UNIX-based systems, including MacOS, this list is taken either
--   <tt><i>usr</i>share<i>dict</i>words</tt> or
--   <tt><i>usr</i>dict/words</tt>, whichever is the first that exists. If
--   neither path exists, then the list is taken from a built-in collection
--   of English language words.
--   
--   Better localization would be nice for platforms that do not have words
--   files.
