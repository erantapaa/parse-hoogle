-- | Minimalistic type-checked compile-time template engine
--   
--   The library integrates flawlessly with Haskell's new <a>first-class
--   records</a>.
--   
--   It inherits a remarkable quality from the dogs however: unlike most
--   other template engines at compile time it barks at you whenever you do
--   anything wrong in your templates. Hence the title (from Russian "lai"
--   means "bark"). Also it commemorates Laika, the hero dog, which became
--   the first animal to orbit Earth and died in space.
