-- | Kolmogov-Smirnov tests are non-parametric tests for assesing whether
--   given sample could be described by distribution or whether two samples
--   have the same distribution. It's only applicable to continous
--   distributions.
module Statistics.Test.KolmogorovSmirnov

-- | Check that sample could be described by distribution.
--   <a>Significant</a> means distribution is not compatible with data for
--   given p-value.
--   
--   This test uses Marsaglia-Tsang-Wang exact alogorithm for calculation

kolmogorovSmirnovTestCdf :: (Double -> Double) -> Double -> Sample -> TestResult

-- | Two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. It tests whether two data samples
--   could be described by the same distribution without making any
--   assumptions about it.
--   
--   This test uses approxmate formula for computing p-value.
kolmogorovSmirnovTest2 :: Double -> Sample -> Sample -> TestResult

module Statistics.Test.KruskalWallis

-- | Kruskal-Wallis ranking.
--   
--   All values are replaced by the absolute rank in the combined samples.
--   
--   The samples and values need not to be ordered but the values in the
--   result are ordered. Assigned ranks (ties are given their average
--   rank).
kruskalWallisRank :: [Sample] -> [Sample]

-- | The Kruskal-Wallis Test.
--   
--   In textbooks the output value is usually represented by <tt>K</tt> or
--   <tt>H</tt>. This function already does the ranking.
kruskalWallis :: [Sample] -> Double

-- | Calculates whether the Kruskal-Wallis test is significant.
--   
--   It uses <i>Chi-Squared</i> distribution for aproximation as long as
--   the sizes are larger than 5. Otherwise the test returns
--   <a>Nothing</a>.
kruskalWallisSignificant :: [Int] -> Double -> Double -> Maybe TestResult

-- | Perform Kruskal-Wallis Test for the given samples and required
--   significance. For additional information check <a>kruskalWallis</a>.
--   This is just a helper function.
kruskalWallisTest :: Double -> [Sample] -> Maybe TestResult


-- | Mann-Whitney U test (also know as Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon and Wilcoxon
--   rank sum test) is a non-parametric test for assesing whether two
--   samples of independent observations have different mean.
module Statistics.Test.MannWhitneyU

-- | Perform Mann-Whitney U Test for two samples and required significance.
--   For additional information check documentation of <a>mannWhitneyU</a>
--   and <a>mannWhitneyUSignificant</a>. This is just a helper function.
--   
--   One-tailed test checks whether first sample is significantly larger
--   than second. Two-tailed whether they are significantly different.
mannWhitneyUtest :: TestType -> Double -> Sample -> Sample -> Maybe TestResult

-- | The Mann-Whitney U Test.
--   
--   This is sometimes known as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U test, and
--   confusingly many sources state that the Mann-Whitney U test is the
--   same as the Wilcoxon's rank sum test (which is provided as
--   <a>wilcoxonRankSums</a>). The Mann-Whitney U is a simple transform of
--   Wilcoxon's rank sum test.
--   
--   Again confusingly, different sources state reversed definitions for U₁
--   and U₂, so it is worth being explicit about what this function
--   returns. Given two samples, the first, xs₁, of size n₁ and the second,
--   xs₂, of size n₂, this function returns (U₁, U₂) where U₁ = W₁ -
--   (n₁(n₁+1))/2 and U₂ = W₂ - (n₂(n₂+1))/2, where (W₁, W₂) is the return
--   value of <tt>wilcoxonRankSums xs1 xs2</tt>.
--   
--   Some sources instead state that U₁ and U₂ should be the other way
--   round, often expressing this using U₁' = n₁n₂ - U₁ (since U₁ + U₂ =
--   n₁n₂).
--   
--   All of which you probably don't care about if you just feed this into
--   <a>mannWhitneyUSignificant</a>.
mannWhitneyU :: Sample -> Sample -> (Double, Double)

-- | Calculates the critical value of Mann-Whitney U for the given sample
--   sizes and significance level.
--   
--   This function returns the exact calculated value of U for all sample
--   sizes; it does not use the normal approximation at all. Above sample
--   size 20 it is generally recommended to use the normal approximation
--   instead, but this function will calculate the higher critical values
--   if you need them.
--   
--   The algorithm to generate these values is a faster, memoised version
--   of the simple unoptimised generating function given in section 2 of
--   "The Mann Whitney Wilcoxon Distribution Using Linked Lists"
mannWhitneyUCriticalValue :: (Int, Int) -> Double -> Maybe Int

-- | Calculates whether the Mann Whitney U test is significant.
--   
--   If both sample sizes are less than or equal to 20, the exact U
--   critical value (as calculated by <a>mannWhitneyUCriticalValue</a>) is
--   used. If either sample is larger than 20, the normal approximation is
--   used instead.
--   
--   If you use a one-tailed test, the test indicates whether the first
--   sample is significantly larger than the second. If you want the
--   opposite, simply reverse the order in both the sample size and the
--   (U₁, U₂) pairs.
mannWhitneyUSignificant :: TestType -> (Int, Int) -> Double -> (Double, Double) -> Maybe TestResult

-- | The Wilcoxon Rank Sums Test.
--   
--   This test calculates the sum of ranks for the given two samples. The
--   samples are ordered, and assigned ranks (ties are given their average
--   rank), then these ranks are summed for each sample.
--   
--   The return value is (W₁, W₂) where W₁ is the sum of ranks of the first
--   sample and W₂ is the sum of ranks of the second sample. This test is
--   trivially transformed into the Mann-Whitney U test. You will probably
--   want to use <a>mannWhitneyU</a> and the related functions for testing
--   significance, but this function is exposed for completeness.
wilcoxonRankSums :: Sample -> Sample -> (Double, Double)

-- | Test type. Exact meaning depends on a specific test. But generally
--   it's tested whether some statistics is too big (small) for
--   <a>OneTailed</a> or whether it too big or too small for
--   <a>TwoTailed</a>

-- | The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test is non-parametric test
--   which could be used to whether two related samples have different
--   means.
--   
--   WARNING: current implementation contain serious bug and couldn't be
--   used with samples larger than 1023.
--   <a>https://github.com/bos/statistics/issues/18</a>
module Statistics.Test.WilcoxonT

-- | The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. The samples are zipped
--   together: if one is longer than the other, both are truncated to the
--   the length of the shorter sample.
--   
--   For one-tailed test it tests whether first sample is significantly
--   greater than the second. For two-tailed it checks whether they
--   significantly differ
--   
--   Check <a>wilcoxonMatchedPairSignedRank</a> and
--   <a>wilcoxonMatchedPairSignificant</a> for additional information.
wilcoxonMatchedPairTest :: TestType -> Double -> Sample -> Sample -> Maybe TestResult
wilcoxonMatchedPairSignedRank :: Sample -> Sample -> (Double, Double)

-- | Tests whether a given result from a Wilcoxon signed-rank matched-pairs
--   test is significant at the given level.
--   
--   This function can perform a one-tailed or two-tailed test. If the
--   first parameter to this function is <a>TwoTailed</a>, the test is
--   performed two-tailed to check if the two samples differ significantly.
--   If the first parameter is <a>OneTailed</a>, the check is performed
--   one-tailed to decide whether the first sample (i.e. the first sample
--   you passed to <a>wilcoxonMatchedPairSignedRank</a>) is greater than
--   the second sample (i.e. the second sample you passed to
--   <a>wilcoxonMatchedPairSignedRank</a>). If you wish to perform a
--   one-tailed test in the opposite direction, you can either pass the
--   parameters in a different order to
--   <a>wilcoxonMatchedPairSignedRank</a>, or simply swap the values in the
--   resulting pair before passing them to this function.
wilcoxonMatchedPairSignificant :: TestType -> Int -> Double -> (Double, Double) -> Maybe TestResult

-- | Works out the significance level (p-value) of a T value, given a
--   sample size and a T value from the Wilcoxon signed-rank matched-pairs
--   test.
--   
--   See the notes on <tt>wilcoxonCriticalValue</tt> for how this is
--   calculated.
wilcoxonMatchedPairSignificance :: Int -> Double -> Double

-- | Obtains the critical value of T to compare against, given a sample
--   size and a p-value (significance level). Your T value must be less
--   than or equal to the return of this function in order for the test to
--   work out significant. If there is a Nothing return, the sample size is
--   too small to make a decision.
--   
--   <tt>wilcoxonSignificant</tt> tests the return value of
--   <a>wilcoxonMatchedPairSignedRank</a> for you, so you should use
--   <tt>wilcoxonSignificant</tt> for determining test results. However,
--   this function is useful, for example, for generating lookup tables for
--   Wilcoxon signed rank critical values.
--   
--   The return values of this function are generated using the method
--   detailed in the paper "Critical Values for the Wilcoxon Signed Rank
--   Statistic", Peter Mitic, The Mathematica Journal, volume 6, issue 3,
--   1996, which can be found here:
--   <a>http://www.mathematica-journal.com/issue/v6i3/article/mitic/contents/63mitic.pdf</a>.
--   According to that paper, the results may differ from other published
--   lookup tables, but (Mitic claims) the values obtained by this function
--   will be the correct ones.
