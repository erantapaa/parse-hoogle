module Hails.Yampa

-- | Define a couple of RVs connected by an SF, so that writing to one
--   makes the SF process the value and make the result available in a
--   readable RV.
yampaReactiveDual :: a -> SF a b -> IO (ReactiveFieldWrite IO a, ReactiveFieldRead IO b)

-- | Create an RV that processes the value with an SF every time it is
--   written.

-- | Alternative (simpler) definition to <a>yampaReactive</a>
yampaReactive' :: a -> SF a a -> IO (ReactiveFieldReadWrite IO a)

-- | To be moved to Data.ReactiveValue
combineRVReadWrite :: (ReactiveValueRead r1 a m, ReactiveValueWrite r2 a m) => r1 -> r2 -> ReactiveFieldReadWrite m a
